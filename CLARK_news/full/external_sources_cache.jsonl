He came to the forefront in March this year though when he managed to stream for 31 consecutive days\u2014bar a small break where he took a trip and pals filled in for him. He ate, slept and occasionally even showered in front of an audience of thousands. It paid off, with the \"subathon\" culminating in Ludwig surpassing Ninja's all-time subscriber count of 269,154.\n\nHe marked his move over to YouTube with a daft skit posted to Twitter, which has him getting out of a Twitch-tinged purple car before it explodes moments later (thanks, Eurogamer).

Ludwig Ahgren, who is known by the mononymous name Ludwig on platforms like YouTube, is one of the four founders of Offbrand, a creative studio that will help its partners bring \u201csomething special\u201d to their viewers.\n\nOffbrand is a collaboration between Ahgren and several big names from the streaming, esports, and advertising worlds. Nick Allen, who serves as the President and COO of Ahgren\u2019s Mogul Moves brand, is on board with Offbrand as well. So too is Nathan Stanz, a creator who has worked in the esports industry. Brandon Ewing, a marketing operative with experience at Twitch and Nvidia, rounds out Offbrand\u2019s founding foursome.\n\nSubscribe to get the latest creator news Subscribe\n\nThese four individuals are on a mission to deliver the sort of content that helped Ahgren become one of the most famous streamers in the world. When he\u2019s not chatting with his fans, the 27-year-old creator occasionally uses his channel for large, produced events. Mogul Money, a game show with a similar format to Jeopardy, went all the way from Ahgren\u2019s stream to the YouTube Theater.\n\nOffbrand\u2019s first project will feature one of the most-subscribed streamers in the world: Felix Lengyel, better known online as xQc. On September 30, Lengyel\u2019s Twitch channel will host the premiere episode of Juiced, which Legyel developed alongside the Offbrand team. Like Mogul Money, Juiced is inspired by old game shows. In this case, the goal is to revive the zaniness of \u201chit, youth game shows from the 90s,\u201d according to a press release from Offbrand. I\u2019m guessing an Olmec head will not be included.\n\nThis is not the first time Ahgren has launched a business venture that caters to creators. Earlier this year, he announced Truffle, an extension designed to serve streamers who want to \u201cdo cool shit.\u201d\n\nWith Offbrand, Ahgren is appealing to a similar sensibility. \u201cAt the end of the day I love making cool stuff that really connects with fans,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBy starting Offbrand, I\u2019m able to bring that passion and expertise to a broader audience and to other creators who want to also do cool stuff but haven\u2019t had the time, resources, or infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe founding team behind the new agency definitely knows how to build. Allen previously served as the COO of Loaded; in that role, he helped the talent management firm increase the size and scope of its operation. Ewing, meanwhile, earned some impressive credits during his time at Twitch. He was one of the execs responsible for launching the inaugural TwitchCon, which took place in 2015.\n\nWhile Ahgren gets Offbrand off the ground, he will continue to deliver videos to his expectant audience. He currently has about 3.5 million subscribers on YouTube."}

Sembroski, Isaacman and two crewmates are due to ride into orbit later this year in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nAlthough Sembroski bought tickets for the lottery, he didn\u2019t actually win it: Instead, a friend of his from college days at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University was chosen, according to The New York Times. The friend, who is remaining anonymous, decided not to go to space \u2014 and donated the ticket to Sembroski, a dedicated space fan.\n\nSembroski is a 41-year-old Air Force veteran and former Space Camp counselor who has been living and working in the Seattle area for more than a decade. He\u2019ll serve as mission specialist and will help manage payload operations, science experiments and mission communications.\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been fortunate to have spent years in the aerospace industry, I never imagined having the opportunity to reach the stars, especially through something as simple as supporting St. Jude,\u201d he said in a news release.\n\nWe\u2019re learning the identities of the final crew members for the all-civilian SpaceX #Inspiration4 mission to space. @tomcostellonbc reports from the Kennedy Space Center. pic.twitter.com/NHpmzzmWD9 \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 30, 2021\n\nThe other crew member added to the mission is Sian Proctor, a 51-year-old geoscience professor and STEM advocate at South Mountain Community College.\n\nProctor was the winner of a separate \u201cShark Tank\u201d-style competition designed to reward innovative use of the Shift4Shop online commerce platform. Proctor used the software to power her space-art venture, and won out over about 200 other contestants.\n\n\u201cThis opportunity is proof that hard work and perseverance can pay off in unimaginable ways,\u201d said Proctor, who\u2019s a licensed airplane pilot and has applied multiple times to become a NASA astronaut. \u201cI have always believed that I was preparing for something special, and that moment has arrived with Inspiration4.\u201d\n\nProctor will serve as the mission pilot, backing up Isaacman in his role as mission commander.\n\nIsaacman, who\u2019s a trained jet pilot and will be at the Crew Dragon\u2019s controls, selected the fourth member of the crew last month. She\u2019s Hayley Arceneaux, a cancer survivor and physician assistant at St. Jude. Arceneaux would be the youngest person to fly in space.\n\nThis week, the full crew traced the steps they\u2019ll take at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to walk up here like this in our flight suits and not imagine what it\u2019s going to be like when we\u2019re doing the exact same thing in our spacesuits,\u201d Isaacman, 38, said in an interview for NBC\u2019s Today show, conducted on the top floor of SpaceX\u2019s launch tower.\n\nIn today\u2019s news release, Isaacman said the goal of the Inspiration4 mission is \u201cto inspire humanity to support St. Jude here on Earth while also seeing new possibilities for human spaceflight.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach of these outstanding crew members embodies the best of humanity, and I am humbled to lead them on this historic and purposeful mission and the adventure of a lifetime,\u201d he said.\n\nThe crew members will go through SpaceX\u2019s training routine for commercial astronauts, and ride the Crew Dragon that is currently docked to the International Space Station, known as Resilience. That Dragon is due to splash down with a foursome of professional astronauts in a month or so, and would be refurbished for launch no earlier than Sept. 15.\n\nInspiration4\u2019s flight plan calls for having the crew conduct science experiments over the course of about three days, following an orbit that will extend as far as 540 kilometers (335 miles). The mission\u2019s organizers say that would mark the farthest-out trip by humans since NASA\u2019s missions to service the Hubble Space Telescope, more than a decade ago.\n\nSeveral other privately funded space missions are in the works \u2014 including Axiom Space\u2019s effort to send a crew of four to the International Space Station aboard a Crew Dragon in 2022, and Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa\u2019s plan to ride SpaceX\u2019s yet-to-be-launched Starship spacecraft around the moon and back in the 2023 time frame."}

It taunts us,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cImages of our universe from Hubble and JWST pull on our desires to explore and to seek out new adventures,\u201d Sembroski said. \u201cI am thrilled to be a part of our expansion out to the rest of the universe \u2014 AND to announce I have joined @blueorigin!

We\u2019ve reached out to Sembroski via email and will update this report with any additional information about the new job.\n\nSembroski, who used to work on Minuteman missiles for the U.S. Air Force, was a fault detection and diagnostics lead engineer for Lockheed Martin in Everett, Wash., when he was chosen as one of four crew members for last September\u2019s philanthropic Inspiration4 space mission. He benefited from a winning lottery ticket that was bought by a friend who decided against trying to make the orbital trip.\n\nOne of Sembroski\u2019s tasks during the three-day, free-flying mission was to take pictures of the crew in the capsule and of the planet below. He provided some musical moments on the ukulele in orbit \u2014 and in a video clip that went viral, Sembroski was caught watching \u201cSpaceballs\u201d on his tablet during the crew\u2019s return to Earth. \u201cOne of my favorite movies,\u201d Musk tweeted in response.\n\nIn April, Sembroski left his job at Lockheed Martin and became a senior analytics engineer at DB Engineering in Redmond, Wash. Back then, Sembroski said he\u2019d try to continue following up on his passion for outer space. \u201cWhat\u2019s cool about all this is that when you take a step back, you realize that every company is a space company,\u201d he told GeekWire at the time.\n\nNow he\u2019s changed the course of his career once more, to focus in on his dream destination."}

She unexpectedly stepped down last month after eight years as leader of the party and of Scotland\u2019s semi-autonomous government.\n\nYousaf, who is due to be confirmed as first minister by Scottish lawmakers on Tuesday, faces the challenge of uniting the SNP and reenergizing its campaign for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom.\n\nREAD MORE: Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s exit leaves Scottish independence path unclear\n\n\u201cJust as I will lead the SNP in the interests of all party members, not just those who voted for me, so I will lead Scotland in the interests of all our citizens whatever your political allegiance,\u201d he said in an acceptance speech at Edinburgh\u2019s Murrayfield stadium.\n\nThe SNP\u2019s 72,000 members narrowly chose Yousaf over Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, with lawmaker Ash Regan a distant third.\n\nA formidable leader who led the SNP to a dominant position in Scottish politics, Sturgeon failed in her aim of leading Scotland out of the United Kingdom, and divided the party with a contentious transgender rights law.\n\nThe three candidates to succeed her share the goal of independence, but differ in their economic and social visions for Scotland.\n\nYousaf, 37, is widely seen as a \u201ccontinuity Sturgeon\u201d candidate who shares the outgoing leader\u2019s liberal social views.\n\nForbes, 32, is an evangelical Christian who has been criticized for saying that her faith would have prevented her from voting in favor of allowing same-sex couples to wed, had she been a lawmaker when Scotland legalized gay marriage in 2014.\n\nBoth Forbes and 49-year-old Regan opposed oppose legislation championed by Sturgeon to make it easier for people in Scotland to legally change their gender.\n\nThe gender recognition bill has been hailed as a landmark piece of legislation by transgender rights activists, but faced opposition from some SNP members who said it ignored the need to protect single-sex spaces for women, such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers.\n\nYousaf has promised to push forward with the legislation, which has been passed by the Scottish parliament but blocked by the U.K. government.\n\nREAD MORE: Scotland vows to challenge UK in court over gender recognition law veto\n\nThe SNP holds 64 of the 129 seats in the Scottish parliament and governs in coalition with the much smaller Greens.

The SNP wants a new vote, but the central government in London has refused to authorize one, and the U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that Scotland can\u2019t hold one without London\u2019s consent.\n\nYousaf has signaled he will act cautiously. He says he wants to build a \u201csettled, sustained\u201d majority for independence. Polls currently suggest Scottish voters are split about evenly on the issue.\n\nThe bruising leadership contest has sent the SNP\u2019s poll ratings plunging \u2014 to the delight of the Labour Party and the Conservatives, which hope to gain seats in Scotland during the next U.K.-wide election, due by the end of 2024."}

But he was close, only a few tenths a lap away from the best long run by Carchedi's former rider Fabio di Giannantonio (VR46 Ducati).\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that as the year goes on, we will improve. It's all a case of the first 3-4 races, how high that starting level is and how much you have to build on. Then you'll understand what sort of year you can do,\u201d Carchedi told Crash.net on the eve of the Sepang test.\n\n\u201cI think people forget in a test, it's not easy for someone to be fastest, but when you have 150-200 laps over three days, you have time to get to the top. Qatar has a test before it, but when you go to Portimao, you\u2019ve got about 20 laps and then you\u2019ve got to make Q2 directly.\n\n\u201cThat's when you know how ready you are. Because you've got to have a package, a base, everything that works straight away. Then you'll get more of an inkling [of what we can do over a season].\u201d\n\nThe Englishman, who helped guide Joan Mir to the 2020 title at Suzuki, added: \u201cIt's a completely different bike. It\u2019ll take time. There's a reason it took Pecco until his fourth year [to be world champion]. He scored 40-50 points in the first couple of years. Jorge [Lorenzo] struggled at first\u2026\n\n\u201cI know myself when you go with the same rider to a track the year after, you already know exactly the bike set-up that you\u2019ll use because of how well it worked the year before. It's a big help [to have that experience on a bike].\u201d\n\nHow long does it take to win on a Ducati? 1000cc era: Jorge Martin: 6 starts (2021) Enea Bastianini: 19 starts (2022) Marco Bezzecchi: 22 starts (2023) Jorge Lorenzo: 24 starts (2018) Fabio di Giannantonio: 39 starts (2023) Francesco Bagnaia: 42 starts (2021) Jack Miller: 55 starts (2021) Andrea Iannone: 61 starts (2016) Johann Zarco: 68 starts (2023) Danilo Petrucci: 74 starts (2019) Andrea Dovizioso: 89 starts (2016) 800cc era: Casey Stoner: 1 start (2007) 990cc era: Loris Capirossi: 6 starts (2003) Troy Bayliss: 33 starts (2006)\n\nMarc\n\nNonetheless, Carchedi described Sepang as a \u2018perfect\u2019 test venue for the duo in the sense that it\u2019s not a \u2018favourable\u2019 track for the rider or crew chief.\n\n\u201cMarc\u2019s said it before, [Valencia] is a track he likes. And it's always been a really good track of mine as well. Diggia did well last year, and I won with Joan [Mir] there,\u201d Carchedi explained.\n\n\u201cI don't think [crew chiefs] are any different to the riders. As a crew chief you also have tracks that work quite well for you and tracks maybe that aren't that great.\n\n\u201cSepang is probably one of my least favourable, and it's one of Marc's least favourable. It\u2019s almost perfect in that sense. We\u2019ll see where we are.\u201d\n\nIn other words, sixth place isn\u2019t at all bad for one of their worst tracks, especially given technical problems on the opening day.\n\nCarchedi\u2019s priorities for the test had been to \u201cfix Marc\u2019s riding position and then help him understand the bike more.\n\n\u201cSometimes you try stuff that doesn't necessarily mean you go quicker, but to understand what it does. Because you might go to another track where you need the change it creates,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re almost experimenting. That\u2019s for Marc\u2019s benefit. I did a bit last year but I've got a year [working with the Ducati] under my belt now, so I understand it better.\n\n\u201cBut he'll need to understand how it reacts because something silly like changing 4 millimetres on a swing arm length might feel completely different from one bike [brand] to another.\n\n\u201cIt's happened in the past that a rider hasn't wanted to change something specific because of previous experience [on a different bike] and then eventually he's realised that on a different bike it gives a completely different feeling.\u201d\n\nWith eight bikes on the grid, Ducati has more data than any other factory.\n\nCarchedi, who previously worked with MotoGP champion Nicky Hayden as well as Mir and now Marquez, feels it\u2019s more of a benefit for the rider than the crew chief.\n\n\u201cThe data is great to have but I will be honest, and everyone is different, but my way has never been to copy another set up, \u2018because they've done it, you do it\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOccasionally I'll see the data and go. \u2018Hmm, actually that could be beneficial\u2019. But in general, you have your own way.\n\n\u201cIt's more probably for the rider to compare some corners where he might be struggling.\n\n\u201cI always try to get the balance of the bike correct and once you've got that, it's my personal way, but then I'll always do the front-end feeling.\n\n\u201cEach bike has its own characteristics, but you have the same principles.\n\n\u201cYou always aim for a bike set-up to brake later than anyone else. And it's no different with rear grip and turning.\n\n\u201cI'd say you can't go too far in anything, but I remember in Suzuki we went way too far in the rear grip, we had too much and couldn't qualify!\u201d\n\nMarc\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible thing that he\u2019s done\u201d\n\nReflecting on Marc Marquez\u2019s highly anticipated Ducati debut at Valencia, Carchedi said:\n\n\u201cThe last part of last year was absolutely crazy. It felt like a race every week for about three months so you never really got a chance to think about Marc [arriving].\n\n\u201cThen there's such a short time from the last race to the test. But then I turned up to the track, got to the box and it felt like there were 500,000 people waiting outside!\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re like \u2018Wow! Okay!\u2019 You realise how big a sportsman and personality he is. But then 1.5 hours later, you're down to work and everything else just goes out the window.\n\n\u201cFor sure, out of all of us, the biggest change is for Marc. It\u2019s an incredible thing that he\u2019s done.\n\n\u201cI think his smile [after the first run at the Valencia test] was taken a bit out of proportion, I think that was just because of all the pressure leading up to it.\n\n\u201cYou get to ride something completely different for the first time. You've no idea how it\u2019s going to react and then it's like just\u2026 \u2018Breathe. It\u2019s OK. It's a bike.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt's going to take a little bit of time. There's a lot of caution from his side as well. But he had a fairly good feeling straight away\u2026\u201d\n\nFrankie Carchedi, MotoGP race, Australian MotoGP, 21 October\n\n\u201cI went to open a bank account and got a job at GSE Ducati!\u201d\n\nThe career path taken by anyone in the MotoGP paddock is always interesting and Frankie Carchedi\u2019s rise to the top of the sport is no exception:\n\n\u201cI studied sport and engineering at Loughborough University. Fortunately, I managed to blag a degree at the end of it!\n\n\u201cBut if it wasn't for me walking into a Halifax Bank and meeting Colin Wright's wife - Colin was Ducati [BSB] team manager - I\u2019d probably have been in Formula One.\n\n\u201cI was just opening a bank account, she put me in touch with Colin and I think the next day he asked me to go to Donington with him.\n\n\u201cTroy Bayliss had just finished so my first proper year was with Neil Hodgson when he won in BSB, the famous Neil and Chris Walker Show!\n\n\u201cSo a fortuitous start and then my career progressed quite quickly to World Superbikes.\n\n\u201cI got to work with Nori Haga, but in 2005 I wanted to be back in the UK for personal reasons, so I worked with Gregorio Lavilla when he won the British Championship with GSE.\n\n\u201cI stayed there with Shake Byrne, then the Leon Camier year in 2009 - you always pray for a season like that! [19 wins in 26 races]\n\n\u201cThen Maio Meregalli, who is now the Yamaha MotoGP team manager, asked me if I could work with the factory Yamaha team in World Superbike.\n\n\u201cI stayed in World Superbike until 2013, at Crescent Suzuki, which was how I met [future Suzuki MotoGP boss] Sahara-san\u2026\n\n\u201cI got a call from Aspar and Nicky Hayden for 2014, they needed someone to help with electronics for the Open class.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been asked for a few years by Suzuki and the right moment came when Mir joined the team, so I spent four enjoyable years there.\n\n\u201cWhen that ended, I\u2019d known Gigi [Dall\u2019Igna] for many, many years and Gresini asked if I was interested in joining them for 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Suzuki team was very family orientated and I knew it would be hard to find a team like that again, but Gresini really is as good. It\u2019s an incredible atmosphere.\n\n\u201cAnd now having the two brothers has only brought the whole thing even closer! It\u2019s an amazing place to be.\u201d"}

The increasing pressure from the authorities is part of a campaign to eliminate traces of Western involvement in Russian life.\n\nThirty years after opening an office in Moscow, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) appears to be on its way out. The group has become a victim of both punishing legislation designed to constrain and demonise foreign media and journalists, as well as related fines that now stand at 2.3 million US dollars.\n\nWhile RFE/RL President Jamie Fly has condemned Russia\u2019s attempts to force the broadcaster and the Current Time video-producing network to leave the country and vowed to \u201ccontinue to fight these attacks\u2026 through all possible means\u201d, downsizing has already begun at the media outlets. Both operations will \u201csignificantly limit\u201d their presence in Russia and have offered some employees a choice of relocating to the Czech Republic or Ukraine. With deadlines looming over the payment of the fines, and the continued enforcement of Russian legislation, what will happen next is uncertain.\n\n\u201cI am surprised that it was allowed to function this long when other foreign organisations were closed down already in 2015-2016\u201d, said Mark G. Pomar, the former executive director of the Board for International Broadcasting. This American agency oversaw RFE/RL until the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) was created in 2018. USAGM is the federal agency that oversees RFE/RL, Voice of America, Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network.\n\nThe former director added that Russia is trying to shut out the world, stating that that they have been \u201cdoing that for the past five years and they hadn\u2019t got around to RFE/RL until now\u201d. He also stated that \u201cLogically speaking it fits perfectly with what [President Vladimir] Putin wants to do, which is to eliminate any and all traces of Western involvement in Russian life\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s present is in the past\n\nRussia \u201chas always been authoritarian in its own historical way\u201d and is now simply \u201casserting its political traditions\u201d, explained Pomar, now a senior fellow at the Clements Center for National Security at the University of Texas.\n\nArguably, RFE/RL\u2019s departure from Russia could have been predicted as early as 2002. This year saw Putin revoke President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s 1991 decree that allowed the American broadcaster to open a \u201cpermanent\u201d office in Russia, \u201cbecause of its role in the objective coverage of the march of the democratic processes\u201d.\n\nPutin has reversed these processes, thereby making RFE/RL not only irrelevant but now an outright threat to his regime. The Russian government has pushed through five dangerous statutes over the last decade that are meant to restrict and ultimately banish foreign media from the country.\n\nThe first of these is the 2012 \u201cforeign agent\u201d statute, which was recently amended in 2020. This law demands that foreign media must label every text, video, audio and social media release as \u201cfulfilling the function of a foreign agent\u201d. This suggests to Russians that everything foreign should not be trusted and is harmful to the country.\n\nThe second is the catch-all 2012 \u201cDima Yakovlev Law\u201d, which was updated in 2015. It permits the Ministry of Justice to indefinitely suspend non-commercial organisations (NCOs) taking part in \u201ca political activity\u201d, as well as anything that is considered \u201ca threat to the interests\u201d of Russia and receives funds or property from American entities or citizens. The law also prohibits foreign NCOs from establishing mass media outlets. The provisions added in 2015 specify what \u201cundesirable activity\u201d may be banned when \u201cpublished by a foreign or international non-governmental organisation\u2026 as well [its] production or storage\u201d.\n\nThe 2013 Federal Statue on Information, which was amended in 2017 and again in 2019, is third in the Kremlin\u2019s line-up of weapons designed to restrict foreign media. It allows Russian authorities to apply fines and other measures against those distributing online information \u201cwith calls to mass disorder, to conduct extremist activity and to participate in mass (public) events held in violation of established procedure\u201d. Information from \u201cundesirable\u201d foreign organisations is now also illegal. The law also forbids the \u201cdissemination of knowingly inaccurate, socially significant information under the guise of reliable messages\u201d.\n\nTo ensure the Russian media\u2019s \u2018purity\u2019, the 2014 Media Statute and its 2017 revisions dramatically limit foreign investments in and ownership of Russian media.\n\nLastly, the 2018 Statute on Countermeasures is specifically meant to \u201ccounter\u201d the \u201cunfriendly\u201d actions taken by Washington and other nations against controversial Russian organisations such as Sputnik and RT.\n\nViolating its own constitution and international obligations and commitments\n\nThe Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation upheld the legality of the statutes. Despite this, Andrei Richter has noted that this decision was not unanimous. Richter is a media law expert, former professor at Moscow State University and advisor to the OCSE Representative on Freedom of the Media.\n\nAccording to one spokesperson from the US Department of State, the US is certain that Russia is violating its own constitution. Furthermore, by challenging freedom of expression, Moscow is disregarding \u201cthe country\u2019s international obligations and commitments\u201d.\n\nPredictably, RFE/RL\u2019s President Jamie Fly agrees and considers the regulations \u201ca state sponsored assault on media freedom that violates the Russian Constitution and Russia\u2019s media law\u201d.\n\nWhile there is now no Soviet style jamming of foreign broadcasting or Gosteleradio, the communist broadcasting censor, Russia is attempting to censor the Internet. Roskomnadzor, the state\u2019s enforcer of media-related legislation, recorded hundreds of occasions in which RFE/RL violated the \u201cforeign agent\u201d statute since the start of the year. The federal executive body subsequently imposed fines totaling 2.3 million dollars on the broadcaster. To date, Russian courts have rejected all appeals by the American media group.\n\nWhat can be done\n\n\u201cMy sense is that this has to be dealt with at the political level. If not at the presidential level than at the [US] Secretary of State one\u201d, concludes Pomar.\n\nThe US Department of State has not indicated what steps it might take in response to Russia\u2019s actions. However, a spokesperson has said that it \u201cis deeply concerned by Russia\u2019s increasingly repressive efforts to clamp down on the exercise of freedom of expression, including members of the press\u201d.\n\nThe representative went on to say that the expanded reach and employment of the \u201cforeign agents\u201d statute is a \u201cblatant effort to further excessively monitor, regulate, and restrict the activities and freedom of expression for members of Russia\u2019s civil society, independent media, political opposition, and other independent voices\u201d.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken conveyed his \u201cconcern over Russia\u2019s efforts to close Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and silence this valued source of independent reporting\u201d. It is not clear whether the new sanctions, which were imposed on Russia on April 15th for a number of \u201cmalign\u201d actions, also include the Kremlin\u2019s war against the American broadcaster.\n\nRFE/RL\u2019s imminent exit from Russia will affect its nearly seven million-strong audience and millions more who follow its Current Time network. It may also affect the group\u2019s Tatar-Bashkir and Ukrainian services. The related Crimea.Realities project, too, as well as Polygraph.info, a fact-checking website focused on Russia, may be affected.\n\nOn a positive note\u2026\n\nPomar does see an upside to RFE/RL\u2019s current troubles. He argues that \u201cWhen you have a bureau you are also tied down by that\u201d. The former director also stated that moving to another country can help you \u201cre-think the way you are going to have to do the program\u2026 there are a lot of things that you can do\u201d.\n\nAccording to Pomar, the RFE/RL president \u201cis facing a reality that every other Western organisation has faced [in Russia] and so the only thing that the US can do is learn lessons from the Cold War\u201d. RFE/RL could subsequently \u201ctake on subjects that the Russians are trying to control and open them up. So, take for example WWII. They have created this phenomenal myth about the war, which runs counter to the Polish experience, the Czech experience, the Baltics\u2019 experience, the Ukrainian or the American one\u201d.\n\nOf course, there are hundreds of topics to be addressed regarding this era. This includes the 1940 Katyn massacre of over 22,000 Polish officers and intellectuals, the new myth of Stalin, his repression, the gulags, and the dissidents that, according to Pomar, \u201cplenty of Russians don\u2019t know about\u201d. He has argued that these important subjects should be discussed alongside hundreds of others that Moscow \u201cwants to sanitise\u201d.\n\nAs always, the question of funding will be crucial to RFE/RL\u2019s ability to deal with the challenges of running a restricted service in Russia or from outside the country. Ted Lipien, a former RFE/RL president, says that the broadcaster needs additional funding specifically earmarked for its Russian service. This is in contrast to \u201callowing the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to make critical decisions about Radio Svoboda (Radio Liberty) and Current Time in Russia from the remote and over-bureaucratised bubble in Washington\u201d.\n\nDuring Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, then senator Joe Biden saved RFE/RL from being defunded by Congress in the name of a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d. Pomar now hopes that President Biden will involve himself in the broadcaster\u2019s struggle with the Kremlin and its attempts to remove the operation from Russia. If that fails, he believes that \u201ccertain steps can be taken to at least make it a bit painful for Russia to do this\u201d.\n\nWith the sanctions that have already been imposed, it is unclear how Washington can further punish Russia for its recent attacks on free media. Moscow\u2019s moves have included eliminating media freedoms, arresting and assassinating dissidents, cyber-hacking, waging information war, and interfering in elections. Despite the presence of an active opposition in the country, history has shown that Russia does not mind autocratic leadership and can take a whole lot of punishment.\n\nPeter Gross Ph.D., is professor emeritus and former Director of the University of Tennessee\u2019s School of Journalism and Electronic Media (2006-2016).

Scotland's political map has changed from a distinctive red/orange to a widespread yellow.\n\nThe SNP had hoped to share power or exert influence in Westminster - but with the Conservatives commanding an overall majority, that is now less likely.\n\nDavid Cameron said he would govern for \"one nation\".\n\nBut Bob Thomson, a former Scottish Labour Party treasurer who came out for independence last year, said Mr Cameron showed \"breathtaking hypocrisy\" after suggesting during the election campaign that SNP influence on a Westminster government would be almost \"unconstitutional\".\n\nHe said Mr Cameron had put a \"big nail in the coffin\" of the union with his campaign, which he said was aimed at frightening English voters about SNP influence.\n\nScottish Labour's ex-chairman Bob Thomson says the union may not last more than five years\n\nNicola Sturgeon made it clear that the election was not about independence, but the fault-line in UK politics is bound to open again and those tectonic plates could push England and Scotland further apart.\n\nScotland's centre of gravity has shifted to the left politically, just as England's has moved definitely to the right.\n\nThat gap will be harder to bridge without a left-of-centre party with large numbers of Scottish MPs committed to the union, as Labour was.\n\nThe SNP boasts the UK's youngest MP - Mhairi Black, a 20-year-old politics student\n\nMs Sturgeon's party - now the undisputed voice of Scotland - has pledged to oppose austerity.\n\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron wants to cut the deficit sharply, and the SNP will claim London has no mandate to do so in Scotland.\n\nBob Thomson said that, unless there was dramatic constitutional change, the union would last no more than five years.\n\nHe said if Mr Cameron tried to block another independence referendum there could be \"widespread civic unrest\".\n\nThough Nicola Sturgeon did not campaign for independence during the election, she did argue strongly against the renewal of Trident - a submarine-based nuclear deterrent the SNP calls Britain's \"weapons of mass destruction\".\n\n\"[The SNP] didn't run on independence so they can't say this is a vote for another independence referendum,\" said Dr Phillip O'Brien, director of the Scottish centre of war studies at Glasgow University and a reader in political history.\n\n\"But they did run on getting Trident out of the UK, and so the SNP can say there is a clear division between Scotland and the rest of the UK.\"\n\nHe says the SNP will exploit that division.\n\nMore important, he says, is the referendum on EU membership that David Cameron has promised.\n\nIf the UK votes to leave the EU but Scotland votes to stay, the SNP would see it as \"clear grounds for another independence referendum\" and the Scottish people would certainly support another vote, he says.\n\nScottish Labour leader Jim Murphy lost his East Renfrewshire seat\n\nThe Liberal Democrat's treasury minister Danny Alexander was one of the big names to lose his seat\n\nSmiles for the SNP's Alex Salmond who is returning to Westminster after winning in Gordon\n\nLabour stalwart Douglas Alexander lost his seat to Mhairi Black\n\nNicola Sturgeon will now turn her attention to the Scottish parliamentary elections next year in the hope of further consolidating the SNP's grip on the levers of power north of the border.\n\n\"The SNP has sealed its position as Scotland's dominant party,\" says Magnus Gardham, political editor of the Herald newspaper in Scotland.\n\nHe says the SNP leadership will not want another vote on independence before the polls show they can definitely win.\n\n\"What they can't afford to do is lose a second referendum in quick succession,\" he says.\n\nScotland is setting a different course from the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe union which bound them to England and saw them jointly build a global empire is more fragile than ever.\n\nExpectations are running high in Scotland and could easily be dashed, but the UK parliament will now hold 56 restless MPs whose loyalties are not really to the parliament in which they sit.\n\nThe constitutional crisis the vote could engender has only just begun."}

Wojcicki became their 16th employee and the first one to get pregnant. She became the CEO of YouTube in February.\n\nTODAY\n\nHere are seven things to know about this pioneering woman in tech:\n\n1. She\u2019s home every night for dinner\n\nCrazy hours are the norm for many CEOs, especially in Silicon Valley, but Wojcicki tries to go home at 6 p.m. every night to be a part of the family meal.\n\n\u201cI try, because I found that if I'm home for dinner, I can get the scoop from my kids on the day. After my kids go to bed, I check email. It's about having that balance,\u201d she told Shriver on TODAY.\n\n2. She believes being a mom makes her better at her job\n\nNeeding to be home actually helps Wojcicki to be a more effective CEO because it forces her to prioritize and focus on things that have the biggest impact on her company, she noted.\n\n\u201cI want people to realize that it really is OK, that you can have a family. I don't feel like I'm a perfect mom, and then there are times at work where I feel like maybe I wasn't perfect here because of constraints on my time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut having the sum of both of those things going on in my life makes me a better mom at the end of the day, and I think gives me really important perspectives in the workplace as well.\u201d\n\nTODAY\n\n3. Her company offers 18 weeks paid maternity leave, but she\u2019s not sure how long she will take with baby No. 5\n\n\u201cLots of people are asking me how long I'm going take off, and I don't want to give a specific date because I think well, what happens if I get to that date and then I feel like I need an extra week or I need an extra two weeks?\u201d Wojcicki said.\n\n4. Her advice to young women: Don\u2019t overplan your life\n\nNot every life move, like a great job opportunity, will happen exactly when you want it to, Wojcicki noted.\n\n\u201cJoining Google when I was four months pregnant was a bit of a leap, but sometimes you have to do the right thing for you right now,\u201d she told Glamour magazine.\n\nTODAY\n\n5. Her advice to working moms: It gets easier\n\n\n\nWomen who worry about balancing family and career should remember that \u201cthe really hectic period\u201d of having a child is fairly brief, she advised.\n\n\"Having a child is a big life change but\u2026 you can get through it,\u201d Wojcicki told Glamour.\n\n6. Her mom supports her work, so do her kids\n\n\u201cMy mom is a high school teacher, so she would tell me, 'Oh, the students liked the video you posted today. Oh, the students didn't like the video that you posted today.' As though I, personally, posted a video!\" she told Fast Company.\n\nHer children also alert her to fun clips.\n\n\"My kids will say, 'Oh mom there's this video I saw, I really think you should know about it,'\" Wojcicki told TODAY.\n\nTODAY\n\n7. People asked if she would quit when she got pregnant \u2014 at first\n\n\n\nWojcicki is glad she didn\u2019t give up her very successful and demanding career when she had her second child \u2013 though many colleagues around her assumed she would.\n\n\u201cI won't say it was easy, but I decided I'd make it work because I really believed in Google's potential. When you're a junior-level woman and get pregnant, people always ask if you'll quit. But no one asks me that now,\u201d she told USA Today.\n\nFollow A. Pawlowski on Google+ and Twitter.\n\n"}

She\u2019ll be replaced by Neal Mohan, her longtime lieutenant.\n\nIn a letter sent to YouTube\u2019s employees, Wojcicki said she was leaving in order to \u201cstart a new chapter focused on my family, health and personal projects I\u2019m passionate about.\u201d\n\nDuring her tenure, YouTube became increasingly important to the business for Google, which bought the site in 2006, and Alphabet, the holding company that houses both of them: In 2022, YouTube generated $29.2 billion in ad sales \u2014 more than 10 percent of Alphabet\u2019s total revenue.\n\nWojcicki\u2019s departure also has meaningful symbolism for Google and tech in general. For years, she has been one of the very few women to operate a huge tech business.

She ended up arguing that Google should buy the site instead.\n\nDuring her tenure as YouTube\u2019s leader, she made a point of increasing its accessibility to advertisers, while simultaneously trying to wrangle an enormous and unruly group of video creators that powered the site.\n\nThat periodically led to criticism from video makers, who said YouTube\u2019s rule changes and moderation decisions made it hard for them to make a living, and outsiders, who said the company wasn\u2019t taking a firm enough hand to discourage hate speech and other unpleasant content. \u201cWe managed to upset everybody,\u201d Wojcicki told me in a 2019 interview.\n\nWojcicki has spent years working closely with Mohan, her successor. The two of them first worked together building Google\u2019s display advertising business, and Mohan has been Wojcicki\u2019s No. 2 at YouTube since 2015.\n\n\u201cSusan has built an exceptional team and has in Neal a successor who is ready to hit the ground running and lead YouTube through its next decade of success,\u201d Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement.\n\nBelow is the full text of Wojcicki\u2019s letter to her employees:"}

McCarthy told reporters he would not make another run for speaker.\n\n\"I fought for what I believe in,\" McCarthy said. \"I believe I can continue to fight, but maybe in a different manner.\"\n\nThe House looked set to go leaderless for at least a week, as multiple Republicans said they planned to meet on Oct. 10 to discuss possible McCarthy successors, with a vote on a new speaker planned for Oct. 11.\n\nTuesday's rebellion was led by Representative Matt Gaetz, a far-right Republican from Florida and McCarthy antagonist who finally turned on the speaker after he on Saturday relied on Democratic votes to help pass a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown.\n\n\"Kevin McCarthy is a creature of the swamp. He has risen to power by collecting special interest money and redistributing that money in exchange for favors. We are breaking the fever now,\" Gaetz told reporters after the vote.\n\nIt was the latest moment of high drama in a year when the Republican-controlled House brought Washington to the brink of a catastrophic default on U.S. debt of $31.4 trillion and a partial government shutdown.\n\nRepublicans control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority, meaning they can afford to lose no more than five votes if Democrats unite in opposition.\n\nMcCarthy's ouster as speaker brings legislative activity in the House to a halt, with another government shutdown deadline looming Nov. 17 if Congress does not extend funding.\n\nThe White House said it hoped the House would move swiftly to choose a replacement speaker, a position second in line to the presidency after the vice president.\n\nUNCHARTED WATERS\n\nThe vote left Congress in uncharted waters as it scrambles to update farm-subsidy and nutrition programs, pass government funding bills and consider further aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt was unclear who would succeed McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy had repeatedly angered Democrats in recent weeks, including by launching an impeachment inquiry into Biden and on Saturday by giving them little time to read a stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown that he needed their votes to pass.\n\nDemocrats could have saved McCarthy but, after considering it, said they would not help Republicans resolve their own problems.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) speaks to reporters after he was ousted from the position of Speaker by a vote of the House of Representatives at the U.S. Capitol in Washington. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nOther Republican leaders like Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer could possibly be candidates, though neither has publicly expressed interest. Representative Patrick McHenry was named to the post on a temporary basis.\n\nThe last two Republican speakers, Paul Ryan and John Boehner, retired from Congress after clashes with their right wing.\n\nIn debate on the House floor, Gaetz and a handful of allies criticized McCarthy for relying on Democratic votes to pass temporary funding that headed off a partial government shutdown.\n\n\"We need a speaker who will fight for something - anything - other than staying on as speaker,\" said Republican Representative Bob Good.\n\nRepresentative Nancy Mace told reporters she voted to remove McCarthy as speaker because he broke promises to her on improving access to birth control and supporting a bill she wrote on rape kits.\n\n\"I've made deals with Kevin McCarthy, with the speaker, that he has not kept to help women in this country,\" Mace said. \"We have done nothing for them.\"\n\nMcCarthy's supporters, including some of the chamber's most vocal conservatives, said McCarthy had successfully limited spending and advanced other conservative priorities even though Democrats control the White House and the Senate.\n\n\"Think long and hard before you plunge us into chaos, because that's where we're headed,\" said Republican Representative Tom Cole.\n\nNO DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT\n\nDemocrats said they viewed McCarthy as untrustworthy after he broke a May agreement on spending with Biden.\n\n\"Let them wallow in their pigsty of incompetence,\" Representative Pramila Jayapal told reporters before the vote.\n\nGaetz was one of more than a dozen Republicans who repeatedly voted against McCarthy's bid for speaker in January. McCarthy ultimately secured the gavel after 15 rounds of voting over four days. To win the job, McCarthy agreed to rules that made it easier to challenge his leadership.\n\nMcCarthy supporters have said Gaetz was motivated by a hunger for publicity, a chance to win higher office or resentment over an ongoing ethics probe into possible sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.\n\nGaetz has denied wrongdoing and said he is not motivated by a dislike of McCarthy.\n\n\"This isn't a critique of the individual - it's a critique of the job. The job hasn't been done,\" he said.\n\nReporting by Makini Brice, David Morgan, Richard Cowan, Nandita Bose, Moira Warburton, Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu; Writing by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Scott Malone, Alistair Bell, Howard Goller, Grant McCool and Cynthia Osterman\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}

Due to four absences in the chamber, Johnson needed 215 votes to become speaker.\n\nDelivering his first speech as the 56th speaker of the House, Johnson vowed to \u201crebuild and restore\u201d the trust of the American people, which he acknowledged had been damaged by the chaos of recent weeks.\n\n\u201cAt this time of great crisis, it is our duty to work together, as previous generations of great leaders have, to face these great challenges and solve these great problems,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe want our allies around the world to know that this body of lawmakers is reporting again to our duty stations. Let the enemies of freedom around the world hear us loud and clear: the people\u2019s House is back in business.\u201d\n\nIn a statement congratulating Johnson on his victory, Joe Biden pledged to \u201cwork with [House Republicans] in good faith on behalf of the American people\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven though we have real disagreements about important issues, there should be mutual effort to find common ground wherever we can,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is a time for all of us to act responsibly, and to put the good of the American people and the everyday priorities of American families above any partisanship.\u201d\n\nJohnson won House Republicans\u2019 speaker nomination on Tuesday evening, just hours after Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the majority whip, was forced to withdraw from the race amid criticism from Donald Trump. Defeating Byron Donalds of Florida after three rounds of voting, Johnson became House Republicans\u2019 fourth speaker nominee in three weeks.\n\nAn internal rollcall vote taken after Johnson\u2019s nomination showed no opposition to his speakership bid, although a number of Republicans were absent. In the hours leading up to the floor vote, several House Republicans who had opposed previous speaker nominees indicated they would support Johnson, paving the way for his victory.\n\nJohnson\u2019s election brings an end to a standoff that began earlier this month, when eight House Republicans joined Democrats to oust former speaker Kevin McCarthy of California. In the weeks since, three other speaker nominees \u2013 Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Jim Jordan of Ohio, and Emmer \u2013 have tried and failed to unite the Republican conference.\n\nWithout a speaker in place, the House has been unable to advance any legislation. Biden has called on Congress to pass an aid package to assist America\u2019s allies such as Ukraine and Israel, but the House could not take up such a bill until a new speaker was elected. Johnson said on Wednesday that the first measure taken up under his speakership would be a resolution expressing support for Israel amid its war against Hamas.\n\nAlthough Johnson\u2019s election will allow the House to resume business, Democrats have made clear that they will use the new speaker\u2019s political record against vulnerable Republicans in the elections next year.\n\nJohnson has already faced questions over his history of supporting Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Johnson, who practised constitutional law before entering politics, was the architect of a questionable legal argument that offered air cover to House Republicans who wanted to sign an amicus brief urging the US supreme court to throw out the electoral votes of key battleground states won by Biden. More than 100 House Republicans signed on to the amicus brief, but the supreme court ultimately threw out the underlying lawsuit challenging the election results.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some Democrats were heard saying \u201cbye bye\u201d as House Republicans representing battleground districts, such as Mike Lawler of New York, cast their votes for Johnson.\n\nDelivering remarks after Johnson\u2019s election, Jeffries pledged Democrats would \u201cprotect the peaceful transfer of power\u201d and \u201ccontinue to push back against extremism in this chamber and throughout the country\u201d, while simultaneously promising to seek bipartisanship whenever possible.\n\n\u201cThe time for partisanship is over. It\u2019s time to get back to doing the business of the American people,\u201d Jeffries said. He then reminded Republicans: \u201cJoe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. He\u2019s doing a great job under difficult circumstances, and no amount of election denialism will ever change that reality \u2013 not now, not ever.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after Jeffries, Johnson similarly pledged to work with Democrats on points of mutual interest, while acknowledging their starkly different policy preferences.\n\n\u201cI do look forward to working with you on behalf of the American people,\u201d Johnson told Jeffries. \u201cI know we see things from very different points of view. But I know that in your heart, you love and care about this country and you want to do what\u2019s right, and so we\u2019re going to find common ground there.\u201d\n\nEven though the House is now open, Johnson\u2019s challenges in uniting his deeply divided conference may be just beginning. Government funding is set to expire in less than a month, and Johnson risks causing a federal shutdown unless he can convince fellow Republicans to back a stopgap funding measure. That same dilemma caused the downfall of the last Republican speaker."}

She succeeds Barry Hughson, who left the company in January to become executive director of the National Ballet of Canada.\n\nHodges is currently executive director of Gallim Dance, a New York-based contemporary dance company that performed at the Institute of Contemporary Art in January.\n\nContinue reading below\n\nShe has Boston ties, however: She majored in social anthropology at Harvard University and received an MBA from Harvard Business School, and she has also worked as a senior associate consultant for Boston\u2019s Bain & Company. Before joining Gallim Dance, she was senior manager of finance and planning and then project director at the Museum of Modern Art, where she managed a $145 million operating budget.\n\nSpeaking by phone from London, Hodges recalled meeting Jack Meyer, chairman of Boston Ballet\u2019s board of trustees, in 2010 when she was a student at Harvard Business School. \u201cI just remember being very excited about the Ballet\u2019s tremendous artistic success,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that there were really smart people at the organization and at the board, and that was my first encounter with the company\u2019s leadership.\u201d\n\nBoston Ballet artistic director Mikko Nissinen said the company talked to about 10 candidates. He\u2019s not concerned about Hodges\u2019s lack of a ballet background. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a question of the individual, of finding the right person with the right DNA.\u201d\n\nHe described Hodges as \u201ca match for the organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a forward-thinking, quite aggressive organization. We act fast, and when we identify something, we go for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not looking for business as usual \u2014 you know, let\u2019s do steady little improvement in five years. This is an individual who is extremely bright and is also a great people person. And that is important with the donors, and for building teams in the organization.\u201d\n\nContinue reading below\n\nDoes it matter that she\u2019s spent eight years in Boston? \u201cOf course it helps,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter that much. She is hungry. This is her dream job. That kind of uranium energy is exactly what you want. I sometimes joke that I\u2019m the Energizer Bunny who can\u2019t find the off switch. I\u2019m always going and going and going and doing and doing and doing. So I think it\u2019s quite a wonderful match.\u201d\n\nNissinen, the Ballet\u2019s artistic director since 2001, renewed his contract last month for five more years.\n\nHodges cited her years of experience at MoMA \u201cin a very large and complex organization run at the highest standards of excellence in scale and scope and complexity.\u201d And of her time with Gallim, she said, \u201cI think being part of a small company has given me tremendous exposure to the breadth of activity that happens at a dance company: marketing, development, touring, board development, really being hands-on in all those elements.\u201d\n\nShe was familiar with the Ballet during her years in Boston. She remembers with particular fondness seeing Nissinen\u2019s first \u201cSwan Lake\u201d with the company, in 2004.\n\nBut it\u2019s what Hodges calls her \u201cpassion\u201d that comes through in conversation. \u201cWhat really struck me about this opportunity,\u201d she said, \u201cwas the world-class art and also the world-class ambition on the part of Mikko and the board and throughout the organization to deliver excellence and innovation at the highest level. Boston Ballet is one of the best dance and ballet companies in the world, and it\u2019s on the rise. Mikko is fantastic and wants to take Boston Ballet to the top and showcase it across the spectrum of classical and contemporary dance. I\u2019m very excited to have the role of supporting that artistic vision.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also excited about returning. \u201cI know and love Boston very well, and I\u2019m very eager to come back.\u201d Apart from her new position, what is she most looking forward to? \u201cFlour Bakery,\u201d she says. \u201cFenway Park. That moment when you\u2019re riding the Red Line between Charles/MGH and MIT and you pull above ground and the river is full of sailboats. I miss that moment.\u201d\n\nHughson had been executive director of the Boston Ballet since 2009. During his tenure, he steered the $10 million Clean Slate Fund campaign, which retired the company\u2019s debt. He also negotiated the land lease for the company\u2019s Clarendon Street headquarters, and in 2011 he oversaw the $3 million renovation there."}

The announcement comes as the institution, which opened in 2019 in the city\u2019s posh Hudson Yards, struggles to right itself both financially and artistically following a few challenging years complicated by the advent of Covid-19. Hodges in October will take up the position last occupied by founding CEO Alex Poots, who relinquished the role in January, while retaining his post as the organization\u2019s artistic director.\n\nHodges has led the Boston Ballet, one of the nation\u2019s largest dance companies, since 2014. Under her leadership, the organization\u2019s endowment grew from $14 million to $36 million, while attendance in the 2022\u201323 season rose to 170,000, its second highest level ever. As well, she helped lead the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Before arriving at the Boston organization, Hodges served as executive director of contemporary Brooklyn dance company Gallim Dance and held various roles at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Business Schools, she also worked as a senior associate consultant with Bain & Company.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m passionate about audience-building and about access,\u201d Hodges said in a statement, \u201cand I\u2019m thrilled at the possibilities inherent in the Shed\u2019s mission, its physical space, and its art.\u201d\n\nThe Shed had not yet built a core audience or established an identity when the pandemic struck in 2020. After temporarily closing, the institution was forced to lay off twenty-eight of its 107 full-time workers, though staffing levels have slightly risen since.

Oldman reportedly sold off his Hollywood-pedigreed Los Feliz mansion to Hudgens and her longtime boyfriend, Austin Butler, for just under $5 million, a substantial gain considering Oldman originally purchased the home for a bit below $2.9 million back in 2011. Because the deal was done off-market, it\u2019s unclear as to whether or not, or to what extent, Oldman has updated or renovated the home, but according to records, much of the 3,168-square-foot Georgian Colonial house has remained intact. The house is comprised of three bedrooms and four bathrooms, with a separate one-bed, one-bath guesthouse that sits atop a detached two-car garage. Secured gates and a thick hedge help to provide ample privacy for the home (likely a perk for tabloid favorites Hudgens and Butler), which sits on a nearly half-acre of land.\n\nAt the time of Oldman\u2019s purchase , the home was almost entirely covered in ivy, with a modest entrance hall boasting sunny yellow wallpaper and dark polished wood floors as well as set of wooden stairs leading up and away from the front foyer. A living room off to one side features oversize floor-to-ceiling French windows along one wall and a grand piano tucked away in one corner, while a formal dining room located toward the back of the home gets a bit of glitz from a crystal chandelier hanging from the center of the room. The spaces deep blue walls and bright yellow curtains making for a sharp aesthetic contrast. The chef\u2019s kitchen is open and airy, with exposed wood beam ceilings and a butcher\u2019s block grounding the space. The upstairs master bedroom comes with its own en-suite bath comprising a deep soaking tub and separate steam shower, as well as a walk-in closet perfect for wardrobe changes. Out back, there are a number of expansive terraces and a grand sweep of lawn lined with mature gardens and a small citrus grove; a glittering swimming pool and spa set help to round out the outdoor offerings. At present, Oldman primarily resides in Palm Springs, California, while Hudgens also owns a sprawling Mediterranean residence in nearby Studio City, which she purchased for just under $2.9 million back in 2008.\n\nRelated: Demi Lovato Is Renting Her Hollywood Hills Home for $35,000 a Month"}

The actress has purchased a 7,249 square-foot mansion in Studio City, reports Dirt. The five-bed, five-bath structure neighbors the very first property that Hudgens purchased, back in 2008 when she was fresh from her High School Musical fame. The star spent $7.5 million for her new 1963-built abode, which was rebuilt this year in a modern farmhouse style.\n\nThe space is dressed in modern white and warm woods, making it a promising canvas for Hudgens, who is sure to leave an indelible mark on the property. \u201cI wanted to make sure that what I was doing would add to the history,\u201d Hudgens told AD of the extensive remodel she completed at her previous home. \u201cI think there\u2019s a beauty to homes that have been passed down, that have marks from previous residents.\u201d\n\nInside, the dwelling boasts an airy open floor plan filled with sun from skylights, vast windows, and balconies that allow sweeping views of the San Fernando Valley. The eye-catching central wood staircase is outfitted with sleek LED track lighting. Upstairs, a modern take on wood-paneled walls adds a warm vintage flair to the space.

{"archive_url": "http://web.archive.org/web/20210423151211/https://www.a-n.co.uk/news/skulptur-projekte-munster-politics-monuments-walking-water/", "source_text": "Skulptur Projekte M\u00fcnster 2017: politics, monuments and walking on water\n\nTaking place every ten years, for 2017 Skulptur Projekte M\u00fcnster presents work by an international line up of around 35 artists who present work in public spaces and museums across the city. Artist and senior lecturer in fine art at the University of Worcester S Mark Gubb reports.\n\nI arrived in to M\u00fcnster on a warm and sunny afternoon, blisters slightly rested after a three-hour train ride from Kassel and two days schlepping around Documenta 14. An immediate right turn out of the station took me through a tunnel under the train tracks. The pedestrian crowds, mixed with a busker\u2019s drumbeat, made me feel like I was at a festival, en route between stages. It quickly became apparent there was no busker and the drums I could hear were coming from speakers set high on the walls.\n\nThis was a work by Emeka Ogboh, who has also brewed a beer, fermented to the sounds of the city of Lagos, available at a few bars and venues around town. The artist is interested in the potential for sound to inscribe itself on to space and matter and the work provided a shifted perspective on a fairly mundane activity, momentarily lifting me out of the practicality of my situation and transporting me, psychologically, somewhere culturally richer and more active.\n\nAs a public intervention, Ogboh\u2019s piece could easily be missed by the pedestrians and cyclists doing their best to avoid each other. So often, this is how the once every ten years Skulptur Projekte M\u00fcnster works \u2013 quite imposing sculptures and installations are upon you before you even realise.\n\nWith German curator Kasper Konig at the helm as artistic director, this fifth edition of the project contains new works by around 35 artists, some with pieces over multiple sites and some working collaboratively. Alongside this are the permanent works from a similar number of artists, gradually collected over previous editions, so there\u2019s a lot to look out for as you wander the pretty streets and parks of this north east German city.\n\nBy the project\u2019s nature, there\u2019s no over-arching curatorial theme or thread \u2013 it\u2019s simply a collection of works responding to the site and situation in which they are found. In saying that, politics abounds and the works are given the freedom to stand on their own two feet, providing a series of unique experiences drawn together under this once-a-decade banner.\n\nThe scale and nature of the city lends itself very well to the project. It\u2019s quite compact, has a mixture of parkland and water that run around the centre, and it\u2019s nice and flat (unlike Kassel). So while the city provides an ideal backdrop and context for the artworks, the artworks also take you on a literal journey, highlighting the best of what this little city has to offer.\n\nAs artists always do, the definition of what can be classed as a piece of sculpture on a trail is pushed to its limits, so certain works are only accessible under certain conditions, or at certain times, while others utilise spaces to provide experiences more recognisable as sculptural installations than stand-alone sculpture. Part of me wonders whether this may, in part, be due to the fact that many of the best sites are now taken up by the permanent works, and no-one really wants to put themselves in direct competition with an Oldenburg, a Serra, or a Nauman, do they?\n\nThis year\u2019s project provides an array of experiences beyond that of simply viewing: you can get a tattoo (Michael Smith), walk across the water in the harbour (Ay\u015fe Erkmen), get lost in an apartment (Gregor Schnieder), walk through the muddy bed of an excavated ice-rink (Pierre Huyghe) or hang out by an art-pond in the park (Nicole Eisenman).\n\nThe official app is very useful, if you can afford to have data roaming switched on, as it pings up notifications when you\u2019re in the vicinity of past and present works.\n\nLara Favaretto \u2013 Momentary Monument: The Stone\n\nI\u2019d barely stepped off the bus when my app informed me this work by Lara Favaretto was nearby. Having read about it I wasn\u2019t so interested, but the crowd gathered around it drew me over to what proved to be a surprisingly engaging piece. Presented is a large granite block, excavation marks scarring its sides and instantly recognisable as the kind of monolithic piece of material we so often see deposited in municipal centres as artworks or monuments.\n\nWhat makes this different is a slot cut in to one face. Further investigation reveals that the block has been hollowed out and the slot is an invitation to deposit money. This seems entirely in keeping with the visitor tradition of throwing coins in to fountains and other bodies of water and there\u2019s a pleasing depth, in a physical and audio sense, to the slide of the coins as they head down in to the rock\u2019s interior.\n\nAt the end of the project the plan is for the granite to be repurposed and the money collected donated to the Buren Prisoners Aid Association, to help refugees facing deportation.\n\nAram Bartholl \u2013 12V, 5V, 3V\n\nOne of the constant pleasures and frustrations of the project is following the mostly excellent map, only to struggle in locating the artwork. The first piece of Aram Bartholl\u2019s I went looking for, one of three, proved to be such a challenge. I\u2019d nearly given up when some people emerging from an underpass hinted at its location.\n\nOnce inside, the underpass is lit by a series of chandelier-type lights hanging from the ceiling. Each ring contains a collection of burning tea-lights. However, it\u2019s not the light these give off that\u2019s of concern but the heat, which is converted directly in to electricity that powers rings of LEDs to illuminate the space.\n\nOn one level a fairly simple, and arguably pointless, display of classroom science \u2013 you could ask why convert the heat to light when then tea-lights already give off light? But that would be to miss the point and beauty entirely and these UFO-come-chandelier sculptures really are quite beautiful.\n\nThe other two works similarly engage with this conversion of fire and heat to electricity, and near the Pumpenhaus provide the opportunity for you to charge your mobile phone while taking a break or visiting the work of Gintersdorfer/Kla\u03b2en.\n\nHito Steyerl \u2013 HellYeahWeFuckDie\n\nHito Steyerl is one of those artists who\u2019s cheated on the sculpture trail and gone for a full installation in the foyer of the LBS savings bank on the edge of M\u00fcnster\u2019s green promenade. That said, it\u2019s an entirely fitting site for a work that, on first glance, feels quite clinical and distancing but quickly reveals a humour and dystopian critique of our relationship with technology.\n\nVideos of our long-proposed technological-saviours, human-shaped robots, contain footage \u2013 actual and simulated \u2013 of our auto-selves undergoing tests to see how well they withstand being pushed over or having things thrown at them. Not so well it would appear.\n\nDotted around the space are three-dimensional renderings of the title, in concrete and illuminated Perspex, bringing a gonzo feel to the whole thing, as though we might be in the lab of a nihilistic technological genius. The calculated layers within the work, driven so much by a cold-pragmatism, come together in the sum-of-their-parts to reveal something that could only be constructed by a living, breathing, illogical, human brain.\n\nThomas Sch\u00fctte \u2013 Nuclear Temple\n\nAcross the road from Steyerl, nestled just inside the greenery of the promenade, is Thomas Sch\u00fctte\u2019s oxidized-steel Nuclear Temple. This is a metal dome that feels like an architectural proposition or model and is a nice partner work to Steyerl. As busy and anxious as Steyerl\u2019s work is, there\u2019s a calm simplicity to this piece that can be read in many ways, one of which must surely be a future vision of a post-nuclear age, in every interpretation of the phrase. Whereas Steyerl revels in the complexities of how technology and man fit together or not, this work contains a very human proposition that, once again, may be the legacy of our illogical human brains.\n\nAy\u015fe Erkmen \u2013 On Water\n\nOn arriving at the harbour, streams of people are seemingly walking on water from one bank to the other. Quite apart from the obvious walking-on-water connection, there\u2019s a religious feeling to this sight, something akin to people bathing in the Ganges or some other such spiritually important body of water. At the same time the work speaks of a pilgrimage or migration and the impossibility of the task being undertaken, were it not for the short walkway that Ay\u015fe Erkmen has introduced just below the surface of the water connecting the two sides of the harbour.\n\nThe opportunity to walk from one side to the other provides an entirely shifted perspective on the usual physical relationship that\u2019s possible within the space, at the same time forcing people in to a communal act or experience. There is unadulterated joy on most people\u2019s faces as they experience this simplest of pleasures \u2013 essentially going for a paddle. The dogs encouraged across by their owners look less sure.\n\nGregor Schnieder \u2013 N.Schmidt, Pferdegasse 19, 48143, M\u00fcnster, Deutschland\n\nGregor Schneider provides an unsettling domestic experience, accessed individually through a door at the side of the LWL-Museum. There\u2019s trepidation in the queue, particularly as the people coming back out don\u2019t necessarily reappear in the order they went in. Up some stairs is an entrance to an empty flat \u2013 empty of other people, furniture or much light. Moving through the two reception rooms the instinct is to look for additional clues to inform the experience before passing in to a bathroom, complete with dripping shower and the urine of the former resident in the un-flushed toilet.\n\nI\u2019ll spare any more detail at risk of being the person telling you that Bruce Willis is a ghost at the end of The Sixth Sense. Suffice to say that Schnieder really is a master at providing an emotionally unsettling experience, without ever falling into the trap of being hammy or shocking. The experience is at once entirely familiar and completely alien, much like a nightmare in a domestic setting.\n\nSkulptur Projekte M\u00fcnster continues until 1 October 2017\n\nImages:\n\n1.

With the seeming entrenchment of populism, the consolidation of market and religious fundamentalism, the popularity of ethnic nationalism, the continuation and reconfiguration of gendered and racial forms of domination\u2014all influenced by ongoing processes of globalization and digitization\u2014we find ourselves at a historic crossroads.

Credit: Nanci Bompey\n\nInstead of dragging 25 kilograms of rock samples up seven floors to the roof of his hotel in Kathmandu, the tectonics graduate student at Queen\u2019s University in Canada took them out to the adjacent alley. Soucy La Roche and his field assistant, Nigel Bocking, started packing the millions-of-years-old rock samples for the trip home.\n\nThen the shaking started.\n\n\u201cIt was shaking a lot and I thought, That\u2019s an earthquake,\u201d Soucy La Roche said while recounting his experience of the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that shook Nepal on 25 April.\n\nHe and Bocking ran back to the hotel and stood in the door frame until the shaking stopped. The buildings around them stayed mainly intact, although small chunks of building material had fallen into the street and water tanks on the roofs of nearby structures were overflowing.\n\nPeople screamed as massive aftershocks continued to shake the ground.\n\n\u201cWe talked about [the earthquake] for a few minutes and [the shaking] started again,\u201d Soucy La Roche said.\n\nThe pair stayed at the hotel as aftershocks continued for the next few hours before making their way to an open field. People screamed as massive aftershocks continued to shake the ground.\n\nThe Days After\n\nSoucy La Roche knew there had been a major earthquake but had no idea how big it was or the extent of the damage until other tourists began receiving text messages from friends and family back home. Back at the hotel that night, Soucy La Roche sent an email to his family and heard accounts from other tourists about the situation in other parts of Kathmandu.\n\nSorting and packing rock samples in the camp at the American Club where Bocking and Soucy La Roche took refuge after the earthquake. Credit: Renaud Soucy La Roche\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in Nepal. I thought, things are still moving\u2014India is still going into Asia and earthquakes are very normal there; they must happen all the time. But I asked our hotel owner, How often do you have earthquakes like this? And he said never\u2014not that big,\u201d Soucy La Roche said.\n\nThe next morning\u2014after being woken by a significant aftershock\u2014Soucy La Roche and Bocking went to the Canadian consulate and then to the British embassy before finding refuge on an open soccer field at the American Club where tents and supplies had been set up by the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cLooking above, there is absolutely nothing that can fall on my head here, so that was the most important thing at that time,\u201d Soucy La Roche said. \u201cAt that point, people were pretty calm. The initial panic had dissipated, and people started to think about their plans in the next few days: where to go, how to come back to Canada.\u201d\n\nConcern in Canada\n\nBack in Kingston, Laurent Godin, a professor at Queen\u2019s University and the head of Soucy La Roche\u2019s research group, woke up at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday to find a U.S. Geological Survey alert about the earthquake on his phone.\n\n\u201cI saw the magnitude, and I went, oh, wow, this is serious, and I knew Renaud and Nigel were en route to Kathmandu\u2026but I wasn\u2019t quite sure where they were at the time,\u201d Godin said.\n\nAfter trying to contact his students and initiating the university\u2019s emergency plan, Godin received an email from Bocking that they were okay. He also started hearing from colleagues in Nepal and scientists who work in the area as they tried to account for other researchers and the local Nepalese they work with.\n\n\u201cWe do the science, but through the science we work with people and we become very good friends,\u201d Godin said. \u201cYou are 24 hours with them, around the campfire or having dinner or traveling together, so you build bonds. And so of course we think of the science, but you simply cannot do the science in the Himalayas without these local people that end up helping you and devoting their lives to your own research.\u201d\n\nThe earthquake caused more than 7200 fatalities and more than 14,000 injuries, displaced 2.8 million people, and damaged infrastructure in Kathmandu and other parts of the country. The local Nepalese with whom Godin and Soucy La Roche work weathered the earthquake unharmed, but many of their homes and villages were destroyed.\n\n\u201cEarthquakes Are Part of the Story\u201d\n\nGodin, working with a travel agent, managed to get Soucy La Roche and Bocking on a plane out of Kathmandu on Wednesday following the earthquake. The pair showed up at the airport hours before their plane was set to leave, nervous after hearing stories that it took hours even to get inside the airport. Soucy La Roche practiced his presentation for the upcoming Joint Assembly meeting while they waited.\n\nField assistant Nigel Bocking takes a measurement in western Nepal. Bocking and Renaud Soucy La Roche from Queen\u2019s University in Canada spent a month in Nepal doing field work before the earthquake struck. Credit: Renaud Soucy La Roche\n\nAt the meeting in the Montreal convention center less than a week after returning home, Soucy La Roche said that he will go back to Nepal if he has the chance.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t so sure about it the first day [after the earthquake], but it was a risk before and it still is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is nothing that you can control, and you shouldn\u2019t really limit yourself because of that.\u201d\n\nSoucy La Roche, Godin, and their colleagues are trying to understand how the Himalayas formed by studying rocks that have been pushed up to the surface over millions of years by the movement of the Earth. The rock samples that Soucy La Roche was packing when the earthquake hit are awaiting analysis back in the lab.\n\n\u201cIf you make a choice to study an active mountain belt and how it evolved with time, even though you are studying an older part of it, the earthquakes are part of the story,\u201d Godin said.\n\n\u2014Nanci Bompey, Writer\n\nCitation: Bompey, N.

Over the past few years, publications from The New York Times to The Tennessean have added related positions.\n\nNow the Financial Times is jumping on the bandwagon. Earlier this year it hired Ren\u00e9e Kaplan, formerly of marketing agency Havas Worldwide and France 24, as the paper\u2019s first head of audience engagement.\n\nI spoke with Kaplan recently as she finished up her first month on the job. She still has to make a number of hires, but said her team has already begun to influence the FT\u2019s coverage.\n\nThe audience engagement team sits in the newsroom, so when news broke last month that the U.S. Department of Justice had indicted a number of FIFA executives, Kaplan\u2019s group jumped into action by resurfacing old coverage of global soccer\u2019s governing body and creating content exclusively for social media.\n\nRead for free: Fifa moneymaking machine still spins http://t.co/DlQ92OZbaV pic.twitter.com/cqnVhoQB3Z \u2014 Financial Times (@FT) May 29, 2015\n\n\u201cWhen news breaks, the engagement team\u2019s integrated approach [comes into play],\u201d Kaplan told me. \u201cWe are part of the reactive process when thinking about how to cover a story and reach our audiences.\u201d\n\nIn the coming months, Kaplan said her and her team will undertake a number of editorial projects to refine their approach and decide how to expand their ideas to the FT as a whole.\n\nKaplan and I discussed possible projects, the prospects of building the FT\u2019s audience despite its strict paywall, and her other goals in her new position. An edited and condensed transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nJoseph Lichterman: Explain your role. What does it mean to be an audience engagement editor?\n\nRen\u00e9e Kaplan: I think that audience engagement means different things in different parts of the business. What is unique about the role of audience engagement at the FT is that we sit fully in the newsroom. I work across the organization and I have members of my team in practically all the different verticals \u2014 marketing, communications, search, data. Fundamentally, though, I define audience engagement as getting our journalism in front of more audiences and more of the right audiences.\n\nLichterman: So you\u2019re focused on expanding the readership, but also focusing on certain readerships. Which groups do you hope to target?\n\nKaplan: We\u2019re trying to define our own metrics of success: Increasing the audience\u2019s connection with our content, creating more loyal subscribers, growing a sense of loyalty, creating dependence on our content. We\u2019re focusing on our existing subscribers \u2014 what we know about them, what they like, how they want to consume our content. We\u2019re also growing our audiences, thinking about who might be interested in the stories we\u2019re telling in different formats and on different platforms.\n\nLichterman: The FT has a : The FT has a paywall , and I\u2019m curious how that affects the way you approach engagement. Does it limit the way you think about social, for instance?\n\nKaplan: The paywall is integral to our model as a business, and even our model as a brand. Fundamentally, we begin with the premise that people are willing to pay for excellent content. : The paywall is integral to our model as a business, and even our model as a brand. Fundamentally, we begin with the premise that people are willing to pay for excellent content. There are lots of ways to access our content. We have a couple of new developments in terms of expanding our reach. One is \u201cfirst click free,\u201d which allows people accessing our content from most social media platforms to be able to click through and read the story free. We have a new access model, which is a shift from the registration model where you could access a fixed number of stories for free. Essentially now it\u2019s a paid trial, where for one dollar, pound, or euro per month, you get whatever you want. It\u2019s very new, but we\u2019re seeing that users are coming back more frequently. We\u2019re working with the paywall. We\u2019re only as good and as valuable to our readers as our content is good and as our business model is good.\n\nLichterman: Are you working to improve content for shareability?\n\nKaplan: We are thinking about how to optimize our content from its very conception, from the moment of commission. Our engagement strategy is two-pronged. On the one hand, we obviously want to grow traffic. We want to reach more more people and get them to come back to the website or back to our content via whatever platform they\u2019re using. : We are thinking about how to optimize our content from its very conception, from the moment of commission. Our engagement strategy is two-pronged. On the one hand, we obviously want to grow traffic. We want to reach more more people and get them to come back to the website or back to our content via whatever platform they\u2019re using. The second prong of the strategy is to change how we produce and distribute our content and optimize it for reach. That doesn\u2019t mean changing the quality or necessarily even changing the nature of what we\u2019re covering. Our brand and our journalistic mission essentially remain the same. But it does mean optimizing some of our content for different distribution platforms, integrating visual and interactive content from the beginning. It means thinking about ways of storytelling that are actually commissioned for social, rather than adapting text-first to social.\n\nLichterman: Can you give me an example of things that you\u2019ve done this way?\n\nKaplan: It\u2019s very early days. I just came to the job. But there have been a couple of breaking news experiences where we\u2019ve tried to do that. FIFA was a major story, especially for a European-based newspaper. Instead of commissioning a classic series of news and analysis in X number of words for the paper, we thought immediately: What is our forte here? It\u2019s the background information on the financials. It\u2019s a lot of the investigative work we\u2019d already done on FIFA. It\u2019s then finding a way to produce and format that content for the greatest reach. So we produced some visuals, some GIFs, we thought of content that was bespoke for Twitter and social that really put those numbers forward in the most shareable way possible.\n\nLichterman: Is it new for the engagement and social teams to be working with the news desk directly?\n\nKaplan: I think the big shift in the industry, and the particular shift within the FT, is that these development strategies, which had resided more on the marketing-commercial side of the business, are now shifting toward the newsroom. So what before was called a community strategy is now called an engagement strategy and is situated in and reports to the newsroom. That\u2019s very new, and very strategic.\n\nLichterman: Are you building a team? Are folks coming over from the business side to the news side?\n\nKaplan: I\u2019m still staffing. Our social media team had already existed within the newsroom. Our audience and digital strategy editor had been on the commercial side. Our engagement strategist, who is very focused on audience insights and research, has also come over from the commercial side. We have a marketing manager focused on content marketing and media partnerships. I\u2019m bringing in data analysts, an SEO expert, and some social media producers. So the team reflects all the different verticals within the business.\n\nLichterman: Will you be working with the advertising or business side of the paper?\n\nKaplan: There is absolutely no interaction between the revenue side of the business and the editorial side of the business. Our marketing manager thinks about the amplification and distribution of our content \u2014 how to optimize the reach and distribution of content with the help of paid promotion that underlines or accompanies the more organic reach of content.\n\nLichterman: The FT recently announced that it\u2019s adding the : The FT recently announced that it\u2019s adding the \u201ccost-per-hour\u201d advertising . Are you trying to get people to stay on the page longer?\n\nKaplan: Again, my objectives are completely distinct from the advertising objectives. I\u2019m interested in extending our engagement to audiences that we don\u2019t have yet, and intensifying and growing our connection with existing audiences. I don\u2019t have a commercial objective. I have an editorial objective, and an experiential objective, and an interactive objective. : Again, my objectives are completely distinct from the advertising objectives. I\u2019m interested in extending our engagement to audiences that we don\u2019t have yet, and intensifying and growing our connection with existing audiences. I don\u2019t have a commercial objective. I have an editorial objective, and an experiential objective, and an interactive objective. Engagement is measured in different ways for different parts of the business. But there\u2019s no part of no media business that isn\u2019t trying to grow the time our audiences spend with our content. Time spent means a better experience and more loyal users.

How does your approach differ for different products?\n\nKaplan: Strategies for engagement and amplification are very bespoke. One lever of engagement is the intelligence about our audiences \u2014 understanding who the audience is for our weekend content, versus who the audience is for companies, or markets, or global economy, or comment.

Princeton and Quinnipiac are a set pair; they go on the road together against the same teams and host the same teams for their home games.\n\nAfter some last-minute bus trouble for the Bobcats on Friday, though, they gave the term \u201ctravel partners\u201d an all-new meaning, when they literally rode the bus together to their games against St. Lawrence and Clarkson.\n\n\u201cWe had just loaded the bus and we were on our way to Clarkson for our game,\u201d said Zoe Boyd, a sophomore defender for Quinnipiac. \u201cWe were maybe a couple of minutes from the hotel and our bus pulled over to the side of the road. Everybody has their headphones on and is focused and listening to music, and we\u2019re all kind of like, \u2018What? What is happening?'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bus driver goes, \u2018Coach, the bus is breaking down. The engine is shutting off,'\u201d said Bobcats head coach Cassie Turner.\n\nFor Danielle Marmer, it was pretty much a worst-case scenario. As Quinnipiac\u2019s Director of Player Development and Operations, her itineraries are always meticulously planned. And the number one goal of any road trip is to stay on schedule\u2014especially before a game.\n\n\u201cWe like to arrive at the rink the same set time before every game just to keep things consistent, so there was a slight panic at first for me,\u201d she said.\n\nLuckily, though, Princeton wasn\u2019t far away. As travel partners, they swap opponents every weekend, in this case the Saints and Golden Knights. Appleton Arena and Cheel Arena are so close to each other that for this trip, both the Tigers and Bobcats were staying in the same hotel. That isn\u2019t normally the case, when they\u2019re playing teams a few hours apart from each other.\n\nSo Turner texted Princeton head coach Cara Morey, her former teammate at Brown, to ask for a ride. Morey said yes immediately.\n\nPrinceton hadn\u2019t left the hotel yet for their game against St. Lawrence, so they decided to just pick up the stranded Bobcats and take the bus together.\n\n\u201cThey get ready a little bit earlier than us, so the hardest part was getting my players to get on the bus because they were stranded, and it was cold,\u201d Morey said. \u201cSo the hardest part was getting my players to get in their dress clothes and get on the bus early.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the Bobcats realized they had one other problem to deal with: getting off of the bus. When they broke down, they pulled over right up next to a snow bank, which was packed in hard by the freezing weather. The door to the bus was almost completely blocked from opening.\n\nThe team started looking for something they could use to dig out some of the snow from inside the bus, through the small opening they had. Assistant coach Eddie Ardito used a Lysol can to try and break up some of the rock-hard snow, and make a big enough opening for Marmer to squeeze through.\n\n\u201cI told Eddie to just make as much room as he could, and then I slid out and took the Lysol can and just started banging against the icy snow just trying to make enough room to open the door,\u201d Marmer said. \u201cWe got it about halfway and that\u2019s all we needed to get everyone off once Princeton\u2019s bus arrived.\n\n\u201cI was ankle-deep, shin-deep in snow and I had my dress coat on and dress pants and everything. It was funny.\u201d\n\nWhen you put together your team\u2019s staff, \u201cability to dig a bus door out of a snow bank\u201d isn\u2019t generally the starting criteria you go on. But you definitely want people who will bring a positive attitude and problem-solving to sticky situations, and that\u2019s clearly what Turner has throughout her entire staff.\n\n\u201cI believe that the foundation of your team, the people that your players interact with the most, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive so much of your culture and your mood,\u201d Turner said. \u201cCarrie Gaydos, our athletic trainer, she was the first to stand up and figure out what we needed to do. Danielle\u2019s standing up; Maggie [Pruitt], our SID, is standing up; everyone is there trying to figure out how they\u2019re going to help. Not once was their concern about, \u2018Oh my goodness, I\u2019m wearing my dress shoes,\u2019 none of that.\n\n\u201cOnce we got to the rink, there was a lot of socks going on the glove dryer, but all was good.\u201d\n\nAfter they were finally out, the Bobcats joined Princeton on their bus to head to their respective games. Instead of sitting separately, they mingled with players from the other team\u2014an intentional move on the Tigers\u2019 part.\n\n\u201cI had said, \u2018O.K., you guys double up at the front, because we\u2019re going to get off first,\u2019 and [my players] were like, \u2018No way, we want to sit with them, we want to make new friends.\u2019 And so they were all sprinkled throughout the bus,\u201d Morey said.\n\nThere were plenty of old friends on the bus, too. The coaching staffs are both pretty familiar with each other, for starters. Along with being college teammates, Morey and Turner have both coached with Hockey Canada\u2019s programs. So have Princeton assistant Courtney Kessel and Quinnipiac assistant Amanda Mazzotta. Turner and Princeton assistant Melanie Ruzzi started coaching at the same time and have known each other their entire careers.\n\nThere are also a number of Quinnipiac and Princeton players who suited up together before college. Boyd played for the Mississauga Jr. Chiefs (PWHL) with Princeton goalie Cassie Reale, and with Maggie Connors on Team Canada\u2019s Under-18 Team. At home in the summer, she trains at the same gym as Princeton forwards Kayla and Sarah Fillier.\n\nQuinnipiac forward Lexie Adzija also played with Connors and Sarah Fillier on Canada\u2019s U18 squad. With the Oakville Jr. Hornets (PWHL), she played with current Tigers Annie MacDonald, the Fillier twins, and Stef Wallace.\n\n\u201cI think at first it was a little awkward, I\u2019d say,\u201d said Adzija. \u201cI actually saw Stef first so I ended up sitting with her because we all sat with one of their players and mingled a little bit. It was definitely nice to catch up. And then just a quick hi to the other ones as they were getting off the bus.\u201d\n\nQuinnipiac\u2019s Courtney Vorster and Logan Angers also played on Canada\u2019s 2018 U18 squad with Sarah Fillier and Connors. Wallace suited up for Team BC with Quinnipiac defender Kate Reilly at the 2019 Canada Winter Games. At the 2017 National Women\u2019s Under-18 Championship, they both played with Vorster for Team BC. Reilly played with Connors and Princeton\u2019s Emma Kee at Shattuck-St. Mary\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI got on the bus and I saw all these familiar faces, so it was really nice to just be like, \u2018Hey, how\u2019s it going,\u2019 and just talk to them for a bit,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cThe bus ride was fun. It was just kind of a big joke because like, what are the odds?\u201d\n\nThe Tigers had some bus troubles of their own this trip, too. On their way up to the North Country on Thursday, their bus broke down and they were stranded for a couple of hours waiting for a new one. Between the two teams, they went through a total of six buses this weekend.\n\nAfter they dropped off Princeton at Appleton, the Bobcats drove about another 20 minutes to get to Cheel Arena to play Clarkson. Unsurprisingly, they arrived later than usual, and had to condense their normal warm-up routine to be ready on time for the game.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I usually sit in the rink for about 15 minutes and do a little bit of visualization and go over some goals and stuff before the game, so I actually just did that on the bus ride once we dropped Princeton off,\u201d Adzija said. \u201cWe were so lucky to get to the rink at a decent time and get a good warm up in.\u201d\n\nClearly, there were some sparks of positive energy that carried over for both teams into the evening\u2019s games. Princeton took down St. Lawrence, 4-0, and after all of the day\u2019s trials, Quinnipiac picked up an even bigger upset win against No. 6 Clarkson, 2-1.\n\n\u201cI think when you face adversity and you\u2019re like, \u2018We gotta get through this, we gotta be at our best,\u2019 I think that something different can sometimes be something good,\u201d Turner said.\n\nIt crossed the minds of both coaches after Saturday\u2019s games that maybe carpooling again would have been a good idea. Quinnipiac, with a new bus, drove themselves to their game against St. Lawrence and fell to the Saints, while Princeton dropped its game against Clarkson.\n\nAs a way of saying thanks for the lift, Quinnipiac left Princeton a thank you note and a tray of butter tarts, part of a batch that Turner\u2019s parents brought down from Canada.\n\nTurner says the whole situation speaks to the relationship between not only Princeton and Quinnipiac, but all of the teams in the ECAC.\n\n\u201cIt definitely helps that Cara was my former teammate, but any team in our conference would have done that for anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a camaraderie, and I think it starts with our coaching staffs, and it trickles down through our players. We have such a great respect for one another.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was neat. It was nice because obviously, there\u2019s a chance we play them first round of playoffs,\u201d Morey said. \u201cBut to remember that we\u2019re people first and then rivals second is pretty cool.\u201d"}

So why now, halfway through her playing career with the women\u2019s ice hockey team, did it suddenly feel like a door was slamming shut?\n\n\u201cI wanted nothing to do with being at the rink,\u201d Marmer said, recalling a period when dwindling playing time and her lack of a clear role on the Bobcats\u2019 roster made the game joyless.\n\nIn stepped Cassie Turner, then QU\u2019s associate head coach but already laying the foundation for the culture of compassion and player empowerment that would make her one of the premier head coaches in the country.\n\nTurner asked pointedly what Marmer wanted out of her remaining seasons and vowed to help her wring the most from her potential. \u201cAnd my love for hockey came back,\u201d said Marmer, a defensive-minded forward who appeared in 132 career games for the Bobcats from 2013-2017, developing into a beloved \u201cgrinder\u201d among teammates for her willingness to contribute momentum-shifting plays that didn\u2019t always appear in the stat sheet.\n\n\u201cHer biggest impact was behind the scenes and how she navigated creating a phenomenal team environment,\u201d Turner said. \u201cShe understood that there were other people feeling the way she felt, and so she really found a way to create an inclusive environment and pass it forward. When I reflect on what she did as a leader, it lasted and continued to ripple through our team for years to come.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before fate and Coach Turner conspired again to present Marmer with another inflection point in a promising coaching career.\n\nAfter serving in a player development role specifically devised for her on Turner\u2019s staff, Marmer was looking to enhance her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Turner spotted an internship with the Bruins\u2019 scouting department, an assignment at which Marmer so excelled that the storied NHL franchise created a full-time position for her in the summer of 2022.\n\nThe Vermont native who grew up rooting for the Bruins would serve as the team\u2019s new player development and scouting assistant, marking the first time the organization had hired a woman to work in an on-ice capacity. She\u2019s one of six women working in player development across the league, per NHL data released last October. There are more than 100 women working in hockey operations, including six assistant general managers.\n\nMarmer\u2019s appointment in such a sports-mad market drew widespread praise, earning her a congratulatory tweet from tennis legend and lifelong women\u2019s sports advocate Billie Jean King. But the 28-year-old insists she is not a trailblazer; it\u2019s more apt, she says, to call her a \u201creinforcement\u201d for a wave of long overdue progress in major professional sports.\n\n\u201cThere are women who are doing this \u2014 obviously it's not at the rate of men \u2014 and we want to get more women in that door,\u201d Marmer said. \u201cI just want to do my job really well so that I continue to keep that door open.\u201d\n\nJust say \u2018yes\u2019\n\nKeeping doors open \u2014 and occasionally kicking one down \u2014 is a mantra for Marmer, who was born in Foxboro, Massachusetts, and later relocated to Dorset, Vermont, with her family. The middle child in a trio of sisters who grew up at the rink managed by their mom, Susan, Danielle was just a toddler when she decided that tagging along and watching her older sister Whitney\u2019s figure skating lessons weren\u2019t sufficient.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the genesis of everything,\u201d recalled Susan. \u201cShe was driving me crazy. I approached the coach and told her the situation and she said, \u2018Well, if she wants to be out on the ice, that's the best time to start trying.\u2019 So she went out and probably fell a hundred times. But she kept getting back up and working on it. That\u2019s the way she\u2019s been her whole life.\u201d\n\nThe Marmers had a tiny yet irrepressible competitor on their hands. Danielle\u2019s trademark was an intense focus, whether she was teaching herself to juggle or commanding the respect of her male teammates as the take-charge catcher on her Little League baseball team. She played on boys ice hockey teams until high-level girls developmental teams beckoned, her talent attracting the attention of, among others, future Quinnipiac assistant coach Brent Hill.\n\nAlong the way, Danielle was gathering plenty of material for two key public speaking engagements: first as a senior at the Bobcats\u2019 team banquet, where she implored the younger players to \u201cbe a senior now.\u201d Then this past August, when she was invited back to the Mount Carmel Campus to give the alumni address at the Class of 2026 Welcome Ceremony.\n\nIn a speech that touched on those same themes of urgency and receptiveness to new opportunities, Marmer spoke passionately about how adopting a \u201csay yes\u201d attitude has propelled her to unimaginable heights and could do the same for 1,872 new Bobcats.\n\n\u201cI urge you to get outside of your comfort zone right away, don\u2019t wait to settle in, and start saying yes,\u201d Marmer told the incoming first-year students. \u201cSay yes to joining a club or an intramural sports team, participate in university activities, scream your head off at as many athletic events as you can.\n\n\u201cAnd if staying in your dorm room playing video games and scrolling through TikTok is more your speed, then at least keep the door open so you can accidentally meet people walking by.\u201d\n\nAdjusted for the digital age, that open-door policy can also mean letting the delete key gather dust. Turner \u2014 whose involvement with national teams in her native Canada dates back decades \u2014 would pass along job postings that couldn\u2019t be found on LinkedIn. And Marmer was unbending in her loyalty to her mentor.\n\n\u201cShe always felt like she needed to apply for something I forwarded her \u2014 or give you a reason why she wasn\u2019t going to apply for a job in France, which was kind of funny,\u201d Turner said. But a chance to work for the Bruins? That was a no-brainer for a New England kid who spent the bulk of her childhood on skates.\n\nIt\u2019s a job for which her three-year stint as the Bobcats\u2019 director of player development and hockey operations certainly provided a dress rehearsal. As did her Quinnipiac education. Marmer graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor\u2019s degree in legal studies and returned to earn a master\u2019s degree in strategic communications, acquiring writing and research skills that serve her well as she files meticulous scouting reports on NHL prospects from the road.\n\nPinch-me moments and puck drops\n\nLike a lot of New Englanders of a certain age, Gary Marmer grew up idolizing Bobby Orr, the legendary Bruins defenseman whose iconic post-goal \u201cflight\u201d in the 1970 Stanley Cup finals is immortalized with a bronze statue outside TD Garden in Boston.\n\nSuffice it to say, Danielle\u2019s first year on the job has produced an endless series of surreal encounters for dad and daughter to savor.\n\n\u201cShe has to just kind of go with it and act like it's normal. But you know, maybe inside there's a lot of butterflies going on,\u201d said Gary, who coached all three of his daughters in youth hockey. \u201cI think she\u2019s had a lot of pinch-me moments.\u201d\n\nAfter learning she\u2019d landed the Bruins job in a phone call with general manager Don Sweeney, Danielle headed off to the NHL Draft in Montreal. She soon found herself at development camp, where she would take part in a ritual that would wobble the ankles of even the surest skater \u2014 like any new player, she took a warmup lap in front of the entire team.\n\nBy the time she got to training camp in September, having lunch alongside All-Stars Brad Marchand and David Pastrnak must\u2019ve felt like old hat.\n\nMarmer spends a lot of her time on the road scouting the team\u2019s minor league affiliate, the American Hockey League\u2019s Providence Bruins, along with the various collegiate powerhouses that reside in Boston\u2019s backyard. Her role is unique from others occupied by women in the industry in that it combines film study and in-person scouting assignments with some on-ice drill work.\n\nThrough Feb. 2, the Bruins\u2019 record stood at a sizzling 39-7-5. They have sustained the best start in franchise history \u2014 which includes a 3-2 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Winter Classic at Fenway Park \u2014 and appear poised to hang a seventh Stanley Cup banner.\n\nDays after the Bruins\u2019 dramatic win at the historic venue, the Bobcats were due to skate on the same makeshift rink as part of the Frozen Fenway event. Needing an alumnus to drop the ceremonial first puck at such a prestigious showcase for the program, Turner said she \u201cinstantly\u201d pitched associate athletic director Sarah Fraser on a certain Bruins employee.\n\nThe choice was finalized just as quickly. With snowflakes falling, Marmer stood at center ice wearing a white Bobcats beanie and did the honors, one chapter of her hockey life colliding with another. QU beat Harvard, 3-1, but Marmer\u2019s journey \u2014 from player to coach to torchbearer \u2014 is a more powerful recruiting tool than any result.\n\n\u201cWe have a mindset within our program that we want women to become the absolute best versions of themselves,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd knowing that, along the way, it\u2019s not a direct journey. You\u2019re going to be uncomfortable. You\u2019re going to be in positions where you succeed and positions where you fail.\n\n\u201cI think Danielle is somebody who's been through all of that, and whether she would admit it, I think she now looks at it and says, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m so proud of myself.\u2019 She can look at everything she\u2019s accomplished and everything she\u2019s conquered and say she enjoyed the process. ... There\u2019s never a finish line. You\u2019ve got to enjoy where you are, and I think Danielle has really embodied all of that. We couldn\u2019t be more proud of her.\u201d"}

I\u2019m just excited to get to puck drop and see the team for real in a competitive environment.\u201d\n\nThe 24-game regular season schedule will feature a dozen home games at the Tsongas Center, running through May 4.\n\nAccording to Marmer, the Lowell venue is the perfect place to make women\u2019s hockey history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to be in Lowell,\u201d said Marmer. \u201cAnd pull from the Merrimack Valley, southern New Hampshire and try to hone in on the communities that maybe don\u2019t get to Boston Bruins games as often. We\u2019re excited for these fans in Lowell to have some pro hockey to watch.\u201d\n\nPWHL Boston has big goals as it opens its inaugural season. The team is hoping to draw as many as 3,000 fans per game.\n\n\u201cThe target is to fill the place up,\u201d said Marmer. \u201cThat\u2019s what the hope is and what we\u2019re aiming to do. We recognize that might not be the case Jan. 3, so we have some work to do. Boston has its passionate fans, but they don\u2019t owe us anything. It\u2019s on us to connect with the fanbase, get into the community to get them excited about what we can bring.\u201d\n\nMarmer is hoping to do that by building a championship club. The rookie GM has had a busy offseason, signing three high-profile free agents. United States National team players Hilary Knight, Aerin Frankel and Megan Keller all inked three-year deals. Knight is one of the most accomplished players in women\u2019s hockey history. Frankel, a goaltender, put up eye-popping numbers at Northeastern University.\n\nMarmer also selected a familiar face in Northeastern forward Alina Muller with the third overall pick in the 2023 PWHL Draft on Sept. 18. Boston University women\u2019s associate head coach Courtney Kessel has been tabbed to coach the squad.\n\nBuilding a professional franchise from the ground up has been an eye-opening experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely different than the drafts I was a part of in the NHL where you\u2019re drafting five to eight players, hoping they impact your lineup for the next three to five years,\u201d said Marmer. \u201cThis was drafting 15 players and signing three free agents. We had to balance talent and get the next best available player with positional needs. It was a bit of a jigsaw puzzle getting everyone to fit, but the biggest thing was we wanted people who are going to be team-first players and great teammates.\u201d\n\nWatching her team finally take the ice for workouts gave her a chance to see what kind of squad she had. And so far, initial reports have been quite good.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d said Marmer. \u201cWe felt like we did a good job with the draft on paper, but it was great to see those players on the ice and confirm what we believed to be true already. It definitely gave us a direction, what our priorities are, and how we need to get better.\u201d\n\nBorn in Foxboro and raised in Dorset, Vt., Marmer played hockey at Quinnipiac University. The checking line forward appeared in 132 career games for the Bobcats from 2013-17, later serving as the school\u2019s director of player development and hockey operations. She was also an assistant coach for Connecticut College\u2019s women\u2019s hockey team.\n\nLast year, she broke exciting new ground by becoming the first woman to have an on-ice role for the Boston Bruins, serving as the player development and scouting assistant. She gained valuable insight and experience on Causeway Street, but when approached to run the first Boston PWHL franchise the following year, the offer was just too good to pass up.\n\n\u201cWhen this opportunity came up, I thought what better way to help push the game and show young girls that there\u2019s an opportunity to be a professional,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic moment, and I wanted to be a part of it. As hard as it was for me to leave the Bruins, the more I learned about the league, the ownership, and resources, it was a movement that I wanted to be a part of.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to assessing talent, Marmer likes to borrow a line she got from Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery last season.\n\n\u201cHe said to the scouts, \u2018You need hockey sense and courage in order to play. The easy way to remember it is that it\u2019s head and heart. You must have both in order to play at the highest level.\u2019 Those were two things we were looking for in our players,\u201d she said.\n\nOne thing is for sure, with players like Knight and Muller on board, fans can expect plenty of action in the inaugural campaign.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get exciting hockey,\u201d said Marmer. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put the best product on the ice, because we have the best players in the world. I think it\u2019s something they\u2019re not going to want to miss.\u201d"}

Eliezer Ruiz (BID)\n\nGovernments in Latin America will have to invest in infrastructure fit for extreme weather while keeping up with fast-advancing technology, says Jordan Schwartz (New Haven, 57), Executive Vice President of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The multilateral bank hosted one of its largest events this week, PPP Americas 2023, which brought together around 500 people in the public and private sectors, to promote public-private partnerships (PPP).\n\n\u201cWe used to use the term \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 for infrastructure,\u201d Schwartz tells EL PA\u00cdS, during the event at a hotel in Panama City, \u201cbut it\u2019s not just brick and mortar now, it\u2019s chips. It\u2019s constant interaction with consumers. This complexity of infrastructure service provision is picking up speed and probably underlying the pressure that we\u2019re seeing from governments.\u201d The bank is the biggest source of development funding for the Latin American region, approving $3 billion for infrastructure last year.\n\nQuestion. According to the IDB\u2019s own data, Latin America is the region of emerging economies that most have private sector participation in infrastructure. What\u2019s left to do in terms of private public partnerships?\n\nAnswer. Since the early 1990s, infrastructure provision in Latin America has worked differently from other middle-income regions. Following the debt crises of the 1980s, there was a wave of privatizations and concessions in ports, water treatment and power plants, and others. When we look at the data going back that far, we see basically an exit of the public sector from the financing of infrastructure. What we\u2019re seeing now is a level of digitalization in almost all of the areas of infrastructure that is new. The new challenge is the level of the technology, the complexity of managing that technology, keeping it up to date and being able to access the information it generates, such as consumption patterns. Buildings are becoming smarter. Roads are being built with sensors to control movement of traffic. We used to use the term \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d for infrastructure, but it\u2019s not just brick and mortar now, it\u2019s chips. It\u2019s constant interaction with consumers. This complexity of infrastructure service provision is picking up speed and probably underlying the pressure that we\u2019re seeing from governments to look at ways in which they can bring the private sector into areas they haven\u2019t been brought into before.\n\nQ. Historically, PPPs in Latin America have been mostly used in electrification and roads. What are the sectors that need the most investment now?\n\nA. The region is quite varied. We have huge federated countries with massive geographies. We have island nations. Some are extremely exposed to natural disasters, and some are more protected and stable in their use of natural capital. We have some that are highly urbanized. So each country has its own particular social and economic needs. Having said that, we\u2019re seeing a massive wall of demand of infrastructure that addresses flood management and flood protection, water resource availability and anything pertaining to hydrology. Whether it\u2019s capturing river flow or capturing glacial melt for hydroelectric dams. We also need to include modern approaches to storage and efficiency in the use of turbines because the underlying water resources are diminishing. We\u2019re seeing an increasing need for infrastructure that protects us from environmental catastrophe. This is going to be a theme that we\u2019re going to be confronting more and more as a region.\n\nQ. PPPs face skepticism from the citizenship, after corruption scandals have exposed how they can be abused or misused. How can one guarantee a clean process?\n\nA. Whether it\u2019s PPP, public procurement or contracting, we have to work with our governments to make sure that we\u2019re committed to transparent processes from beginning to end. That\u2019s not just rhetoric, it\u2019s very specific to the competition and the way in which bids are conducted. It refers to the public information that\u2019s available around the primary criteria for selecting firms, the prices that are being paid to contractors, the capacity to audit the engineering of the construction. There is a feature of PPPs that\u2019s different than public contracting, which is that the firm that\u2019s responsible for operating and maintaining the asset over time is part of a consortium that built the asset. So there should be an incentive to build for the duration of what is, traditionally, a long-term contract. That requires a transparent relationship between the public and private sectors and capacity to audit and regulate. And I should mention we have found that the role of the communities where the infrastructure is being built is unequivocally to be central. There is an IDB analysis that looked at projects where there was social stress and large-scale disputes that came about as a result of projects and found that they were more than 60% more expensive in the long run than those that had been able to, either through the nature of the project or through the consultation process, incorporate concerns of communities.\n\nQ. You talked about building for extreme weather, but what about infrastructure for reducing carbon emissions? What are the projects the region needs most?\n\nA. If you had asked this question five years ago, maybe the answer would\u2019ve been that we need to do more to increase the share of renewable energy in the power matrices of the region. Perhaps, secondly, the mention of e-mobility, which refers to the electrification of our transport systems. Those are still really important areas and many of the countries of the region have much to do to advance in these two areas. But what\u2019s interesting about the question is that the issue of emissions and, therefore, of efficiency in the use of energy, has permeated almost all of our projects in recent years. Even road projects. The quality of the asphalt and off-gassing has become a major topic, for example. It is built into specifications of road projects that we are financing. I think we\u2019re going to see efficiency and emission reduction built into an increasing number of projects, particularly those that will rely on, either multilateral development bank financing, or even commercial financing bond financing. Providers of financing looking to demonstrate that they are contributing to sustainable development rather than whatever is the most expedient.\n\nQ. How should a government choose or prioritize which sector to invest in?\n\nA. Often, infrastructure investment is prioritized through non-economic mechanisms of responding to the perception of constituent needs by the people who invariably approve the investments. There has also traditionally been the use of cost-benefit analysis by financiers such as the multilateral development banks, like the IDB, to try to figure out which investments would produce the greatest economic rates of return. Now, governments are turning more and more towards consideration of social and environmental issues in order to prioritize their investments. The methodologies for how to do that are more complex because not everything can be monetized. Biodiversity, for example, can\u2019t really be monetized. We can monetize emissions reduction, but we\u2019d have to give a price to carbon and we haven\u2019t yet all agreed on what the price of carbon should be and we don\u2019t yet have functioning carbon markets. So often those factors require qualitative judgment. Where do we prioritize social impacts? Which social impacts do we prioritize if the government doesn\u2019t have enough money to build everything it wants to build? Which are the social stresses that we want to relieve? The IDB emphasizes access of the poor to the service, the sustainability and the low environmental footprint of the investment, as well as the economic and financial return. We\u2019re addressing, either a global public good, like emissions reduction, or a local public good, like access of a port to service. That\u2019s where the design of the structuring of the project has become more complicated.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\nReg\u00edstrate gratis para seguir leyendo Si tienes cuenta en EL PA\u00cdS, puedes utilizarla para identificarte INICIA SESI\u00d3NREG\u00cdSTRATE O suscr\u00edbete para leer sin l\u00edmites\n\n_"}

The goal of the Visual Resources of the Middle East (VRME) project is to collect works of art, documentary photographs, and diverse objects from different collections onto one platform, with the aim of introducing the materials to a diverse audience at and beyond Yale. The VRME collection can be found in Artstor\u2019s public collections thus ensuring open, public accessibility to Yale\u2019s extensive holdings. At present a highlights collection, the VRME continues to grow as we continue cataloguing and uploading new material from across the university.\n\nThe archival holdings we are focusing on are housed in the Yale University Art Gallery, the Yale Center for British Art, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Cushing/Whitney Medical Library, Sterling Memorial Library, the Peabody Museum of Natural History, and Lewis Walpole collection. The Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG) has manuscript paintings from early modern Iran and India, and strong holdings in textiles, ceramics, numismatics, photography and contemporary art. At the Yale Center for British Art and the Lewis Walpole Library 18th- and 19th- century highlights include paintings and objects that document the history of the Middle East, especially under colonial rule. Sterling Memorial Library offers visual resources from books and periodicals published in Persian, Arabic, and Turkish, while the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library houses numerous scientific manuscripts. Beinecke Library\u2019s renowned rare book and manuscript collections encompass resources from Safavid Shahnama manuscripts to 20th-century field photographs.\n\nDescription of Holdings\n\nYale University Art Gallery (YUAG)\n\nThe YUAG holds extensive objects from the Islamic Middle East and North Africa. With particular strengths in textiles and ceramics, the YUAG also holds many manuscript paintings from early modern Iran and India. The photography department holds a moderate collection of orientalist photography, as well as works by contemporary photographers like Shirin Neshat and Fazal Sheikh. The Modern and Contemporary department holds a selection of works from Middle Eastern diaspora artists, and these holdings are slated to expand as the YUAG aims to widen its global coverage. The collection also includes historical documentation from the archaeological expeditions made in Dura Europos (modern day Syria) and Gerasa (Jordan) in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nYale Center for British Art (YCBA)\n\nThe YCBA features the largest collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. Included among the vast holdings in paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, rare books, and manuscripts are more than one thousand objects that document British travels through the Middle East and North Africa. While often marginalized as simply Orientalist, these objects, despite the imperialistic views of many of their makers, still present excellent primary source material on the 18th- and 19th- century Middle East.\n\nBeinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library\n\nOne of the most renowned rare book and manuscript collections in the Western Hampshire, Beinecke holds extensive and diverse resources in the Middle East, from Shahnama manuscripts from Safavid Iran to photographs of F.T. Marinetti on his visit to Egypt in 1937. Additional material includes calligraphy primers, ketubahs, Qurans and medieval cartographic works. Moreover, Beinecke just acquired (but has not yet catalogued) the Carney photography collection of Orientalist 19th century photography, which even includes some early 20th-century documentary film footage of Egypt and the Levant. Once catalogued and digitized, this will be a highlight of the collection.\n\nCushing/Whitney Medical Library\n\nThe Cushing/Whitney Medical Library holds rare medical manuscripts from around the world, including many from the Middle East. There are 26 fully digitized Persian and Arabic volumes available through AMEEL. These illustrated volumes will be a unique addition to the collection as they are, like the Peabody objects, not primarily categorized as art works, but rather entered Yale\u2019s collection through the medical school.\n\nSterling Memorial Library\n\nThe Middle East collection at Sterling offers visual resources in Middle Eastern books and periodicals published throughout the Middle East in Persian, Arabic, and Turkish. Ranging from Qur\u2019an manuscripts to Arabic movie posters, this is probably the largest and least well-documented of all the collections because the majority of the visual material is embedded within textual sources. Many of these sources are already digitized through the AMEEL system.\n\nYale Peabody Museum of Natural History\n\nIncluded among the Peabody\u2019s vast natural history collection are a small subset of objects from the Islamic world, mostly discovered through archeological digs. Including some interesting examples of medieval and early modern Persianate ceramics, these objects will be particularly interesting within the VR for their diverse provenance and categorization as artifacts instead of art objects.\n\nLewis Walpole Library\n\nHoused in a farmhouse in Farmington, CT, the Lewis Walpole Library is a comprehensive collection of books and manuscripts related to 18th century Britain. Included among these, are a group of representations of the Middle East as imagined in British prints. Highlights include famed caricaturist James GIllray\u2019s \u201cIntercepted Drawings\u201d which satirize Napoleon\u2019s \u201csavants\u201d and their documenting of Egypt during the 1798 military campaign.\n\nAdditional Yale Resources on Artstor\n\n1.

Dr. Chen has published on Roman, Persian, and Digital Humanities topics, and taught equally wide-ranging coursework.In addition, she is currently at work on a monograph, Tetrarchic Art, Architecture, and Ideology Between East and West (284-325 CE). Taking a transculturally-sensitive, multimedia, and contextual approach, hers is the first book to treat the imperial art of this critical transitional era in its own right, rather than as an accessory in a longue dur\u00e9e narrative. She argues that emperors of this era sensitively adjusted their ideological messaging to address ever-evolving internal and external political pressures\u2014including inordinate pressure from the Persian Sassanid East\u2014and that the stylistic abstraction most commonly associated with the imperial art of the period was not as all-pervasive as generally assumed.She has excavated at the Roman Baths in Iesso (Spain), and at the Roman imperial palace at Felix Romuliana (Serbia), a UNESCO World Heritage site. In 2013\u201314, she spent a year as a fellow in the Department of the Ancient Near East at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York where she worked on the international loan exhibition Assyria to Iberia at the Dawn of the Classical Age. Dr. Chen also serves as co-chair of the international Pelagios Network, and an historical consultant for the Virtual Center for Late Antiquity (VCLA).She earned her B.A. degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the fields of Art History and Classical Studies, and her Ph.D. in Art History and Archaeology from Columbia University. Prior to joining the Bard community, she taught at Brown, Hofstra, and Yale Universities.Founded in 1860, Bard College is a four-year, residential college of the liberal arts and sciences located 90 miles north of New York City.

Before this position, I was the associate librarian for digital strategies and innovation and worked on shifting the library\u2019s focus to digital scholarship and teaching. The current position I am in is about creating a unified portfolio of information and technical services with an embedded understanding of user experience. The hope of this project is to bring all of these ongoing services together and provide a more accessible service for all of our users.\n\nUMSI skills at work\n\nUMSI has really informed my work in a lot of ways. For me, the core classes we took in terms of computer interactions and usability have been critical throughout my career. One of those classes I remember is the Economics of Information course. I was surprised to learn it was a required course for all UMSI students, but I am really thankful it was because I use it a lot in my management and leadership role in the library. Additionally, the project work has been really useful since that is pretty much how all work gets done in libraries all over the world.\n\nMotivation for pursuing information\n\nI was getting my master\u2019s degree in history and got a part-time job at the library. That turned into a full-time job where I met other librarians and information professionals. I found the work they were doing really appealing. I enjoyed being a part of research that wasn\u2019t just my research but the research of others as well.\n\nMost valuable UMSI experience\n\nThe internship I did at the Shapiro Library was one of the most rewarding and impactful experiences that I had at UMSI. I really appreciated having the opportunity to work with the undergraduate students at the University of Michigan. I was also a residence hall librarian when that opportunity was still available for library science students and that was really great. Through that experience I was introduced to how to run a complete library, interact with our users, and even the process of cataloging.\n\nFavorite UMSI memory\n\nAs a residence hall librarian, there was an orientation where we created a video that was a spoof of the Blair Witch Project and that was really fun!\n\nAdvice for UMSI students\n\nFor incoming students, take time to explore all the opportunities on campus. Even though it feels like there is a ton to do with classes, take time to explore the extracurricular activities available to make connections.\n\nFor current students, take whatever classes you can around data: use of data, data visualization, data analysis or research data management. It is so important to have a fundamental understanding of how data is used, collected and organized in the field of information even though you may not want to specialize in it."}

Wones, who is associate university librarian for discovery and access at Harvard Library. Wones, with 20 years\u2019 experience as a leader in academic libraries, will start her new post July 1, following University Librarian Jeffrey MacKie-Mason\u2019s retirement.\n\nIn a recent interview with Berkeley News, Wones said a love of libraries, which she developed in childhood, is part of her family tree, which includes her maternal grandmother, who was a town librarian, and her paternal grandmother, whose passion for libraries was honored after her death with a scholarship for library students.\n\nThe best part of being a librarian, said Wones, \"is being part of the solution\" for those searching for the right resources to gain knowledge and advance their research. At Berkeley, she\u2019ll be chief executive officer of a system of 20 campus libraries, working with faculty, staff and students to keep the UC Berkeley Library strong, pivotal and relevant for today\u2019s users.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s commitment to open access \u2014 the free, immediate, online availability of research published in journals and books \u2014 attracted Wones to the position, as well as the many other ways the campus strives to remedy global inequities.\n\n\"At this point in my life,\" Wones wrote to the hiring committee, \"I would not work for an institution that did not expressly call out this work as a strategic priority.\" She pledged to bring that mindset to Berkeley \"and strive to create a culture at the library where we acknowledge that we are constantly learning, growing and working together to create local and global change.\"\n\nThe following are excerpts from that Berkeley News interview.\n\nBerkeley News: What drew you to the position of university librarian at UC Berkeley, and to the campus?\n\nSuzanne L. Wones: I\u2019m deeply honored to be invited to lead the UC Berkeley Library. It is an amazing collection and a renowned system. I\u2019m eager to build on the work of University Librarian Jeffrey MacKie-Mason and the library to promote the principles of open access and to digitize the remarkable collection held by the library. At Harvard University, I\u2019ve been a tireless advocate for digitization and making the rare and unique items in our collections free and open for scholars worldwide. I oversaw the creation of the Harvard Digital Collections platform to make the more than 6 million digital objects, currently available to all, more discoverable and usable by researchers.\n\nI also am deeply committed to the work of confronting systemic racism and biases in our society, and it will be invigorating to work for an institution that calls out that work so prominently for campus leaders.\n\nComprising 20 libraries, UC Berkeley Library includes the trove at the Bancroft Library of primary documents chronicling the West, the collaborative and innovative spaces at Moffitt Library, and the vast and unparalleled collections at Doe Library, pictured here. Together, these libraries help sustain Berkeley as a leading producer of knowledge. Pierre Carrillo for UC Berkeley Library\n\nI\u2019ve heard many great things about the UC Berkeley community and am looking forward to being part of it. I especially am eager to get to know and lead the UC Berkeley Library, which is filled with special people and spaces and collections. I\u2019ve heard the library staff described as some of the most engaged and dedicated employees imaginable, and I\u2019m eager to work with them to find out about their biggest challenges and greatest opportunities. Every day, the library\u2019s users on campus and around the world benefit from their unique and important work.\n\nOn the day I visited Berkeley, the sky was a brilliant blue, and I could not believe how beautiful the campus was. While I can\u2019t wait to explore all parts of campus and every corner of the libraries, I am most excited about meeting my new colleagues and engaging in the intellectual work of the university.\n\nWhere did your interest in libraries begin?\n\nI have always loved libraries. I grew up mostly in Blacksburg, Virginia; my family moved there when I was in third grade, and we frequently went to the library. I remember once, when I was in middle school, my father, who was a professor of geology, took me to the Virginia Tech library specifically to show me their amazing new online catalog. He loved libraries, as did my mother.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I started library school that my mother told me that my maternal grandmother had run the public library in Ayer, Massachusetts. She had become the town librarian after leaving the field of nursing to raise a family. My other grandmother also was a nurse. When her husband, my grandfather, retired, they settled in Normal, Illinois. After my grandmother passed away, he set up a scholarship for library students in her name due to her strong love of libraries. It was fun for me to see support for libraries on both sides of my family tree.\n\nYour passion for racial and social justice also has deep roots. Tell us about that, how it\u2019s led you into action for change and how libraries can help address inequities.\n\nThroughout my academic and professional career, addressing the inequities in American society has been one of my most deeply held values. Studying history as an undergraduate at University of Massachusetts in college opened my eyes to the damage done to marginalized groups in the U.S. since its earliest days. When I earned my master\u2019s degree in American history at University of New Hampshire, I focused explicitly on issues of diversity and wrote my thesis on the intersectionality between race, gender and American identity in African American women\u2019s organizations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nAs a resident assistant in a graduate student dorm, and later as a library employee at the University of Michigan\u2019s Shapiro Undergraduate Library and at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government Library and Harvard Law School Library, I learned how important it is to foster inclusive communities where everyone can feel safe and supported and do their best work.\n\nIn my role today at Harvard Library, I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to drive projects designed to further our university goals of equity, diversity, inclusion, belonging and antiracism (EDIBA), including through digitizing materials from our special collections that highlight the experience of underrepresented populations and launching a partnership with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to increase their digitization of archives and special collections.\n\nOf joining the Berkeley community, Wones said, \"I am deeply committed to the work of confronting systemic racism and biases in our society and feel invigorated by working for an institution that calls out that work so prominently for campus leaders.\" Steph Stevens for Harvard University\n\nI also co-led with Dr. Jerome Offord a renovation of a generic reading room in Harvard\u2019s Widener Library into a reading room with a browsing collection focused on EDIBA issues and perspectives, as well as a project to strengthen the infrastructure for digitization and digital preservation of collections pertaining to African American history stewarded by historically Black U.S. colleges and universities.\n\nLibraries are stewards of and incubators of knowledge. As we support the creation of new scholarship, we can help address inequities by making sure that the wisdom of a wide variety of cultures, communities and individuals is published, purchased and preserved. In our spaces, we can celebrate the panoply of discoveries made by a vast variety of individuals. We can also make sure that everyone feels welcome in the library and is comfortable availing themselves of all our services.\n\nWhat role do you see for generative artificial intelligence at UC Berkeley Library?\n\nDigitization is simply the first step in making collections more accessible. The exciting developments in generative AI being released to the public in the past few months have demonstrated how much potential digital collections have as mass sources of information and data. At Berkeley, I will engage with my university and library colleagues to ensure the library is an active member of opportunities and collaborations to enact ethical uses of AI using library content and in the instruction of students and faculty on the deployment of AI tools.\n\nThe Center for Connected Learning at Moffitt Library could be an ideal place to center this work. The center is an exciting opportunity to redefine the student library experience, and my background driving digital initiatives positions me well to bring this vision to life. I\u2019m eager to engage faculty, students, library staff, alumni and donors around this transformative project.\n\nWhether helping a student find a resource they didn\u2019t know existed or helping a department rethink how it is achieving its pedagogical goals, the best part of this field is the chance to help scholars advance their research and create new knowledge.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing in your free time, and what\u2019s on your list to explore as a California newcomer?\n\nI like hiking and spending time in and on the water \u2014 swimming, kayaking and canoeing \u2014 so I\u2019m looking forward to discovering the trails and coast of Northern California. I\u2019ve also long wanted to dine at Chez Panisse. I\u2019m moving here with my husband, Scott, and our 19-year-old son, Henry, who is a freshman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and our two cats, Simba and Macy.\n\nMy indoor hobbies include visiting museums, so I look forward to the Bay Area\u2019s cultural institutions, and reading, naturally.

In 1996, California voters passed ballot Proposition 209, which banned race and gender as factors in state university admissions, as well as hiring and contracting. Zachary Bleemer has studied the impact of that ballot proposition. He's an incoming assistant professor of economics at Princeton University. He spoke with A. Mart\u00ednez.\n\nA MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST:\n\nNow, Proposition 209 ended affirmative action admissions practices in California's public universities. How did that change the student makeup of those places?\n\nZACHARY BLEEMER: Yeah, So Berkeley and UCLA, the most selective public universities in the state, saw a declines in Black and Hispanic enrollment of about 40% immediately the year after the Proposition was implemented. There was no net change in black and Hispanic enrollment at less selective California universities because while some black and Hispanic students lost access to those schools because affirmative action ended, they also gained Black and Hispanic students from more selective schools like Berkeley and UCLA that those students could no longer get into. So you saw pretty big changes at the most selective universities but no net changes in the middle and, if anything, small increases in Black and Hispanic enrollment at the least selective public universities in the state.\n\nMART\u00cdNEZ: So it sounds like California has served as a quarter of a century experiment on this.\n\nBLEEMER: That's, I think, exactly right. California only banned affirmative action at public, not private, universities. But I think we can get a pretty good sense of the long-run ramifications of affirmative action bans by seeing what happened in California when that ban was implemented in 1998.\n\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Now, your research goes beyond college life to long-term economic outcomes resulting from the '96 ban. What did you find?\n\nBLEEMER: So when you compare Black and Hispanic and Native American Californians who turned 18 in 1998, one year too late for them to take advantage of the University of California's prior affirmative action policies, you see that, you know, they enroll at less selective universities because affirmative action was unavailable. And that has long-run ramifications for those students. They're less likely to earn graduate degrees. Among lower-testing students, they're less likely to ever earn an undergraduate degree at all. They're less likely to earn degrees in lucrative STEM fields. And if you follow them into the labor market, for the subsequent 15 or 20 years, they're earning about 5% lower wages than they would have earned if they'd had access to more selective universities under affirmative action.\n\nBlack and Hispanic students saw substantially poorer long-run labor market prospects as a result of losing access to these very selective universities. But there was no commensurate gain in long-run outcomes for the white and Asian students who took their place. It seems like these very selective public universities in California just provided greater value to relatively disadvantaged Black and Hispanic students who came from lower-income neighborhoods, had poorer job networks, relatively less access to otherwise successful peers, and who were thus able to better take advantage of the resources provided by these super selective universities than the white and Asian students who took their places.\n\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Zach Bleemer is an incoming assistant professor of economics at Princeton University.

Jack Dorsey, one of the cofounders of the social media start-up, had recently returned to the company as CEO, taking over from Dick Costolo, who had taken Twitter public a couple of years earlier. This wasn\u2019t the first time Dorsey had run Twitter. As I detailed in my book on the early days of Twitter, Hatching Twitter, Dorsey had served as CEO during the company\u2019s nascent years, before being kicked out because he had no idea how to run a company. Evan Williams, Twitter\u2019s other cofounder, took over. Dorsey, incensed by the fact that he had been ousted, then came back to oust Williams, and the CEO musical chairs went on for a decade until Dorsey again returned to lead Twitter during the Trump era. My question for the executives I was meeting with that year was simple: What happens if Dorsey was (once again) unsuccessful in growing Twitter to its full potential? Who would take over next? At the time I was told by the board of Twitter that \u201cThere is no plan B.\u201d It was Jack Dorsey or bust.\n\nOn Monday, five years after that proclamation, Dorsey announced he was resigning from Twitter. Plan B, it turns out, is the company\u2019s chief technology officer, Parag Agrawal. In a resignation letter, Dorsey said, \u201cAfter almost 16 years of having a role at our company\u2026from co-founder to CEO to Chair to Exec Chair to interim-CEO to CEO\u2026I decided it\u2019s finally time for me to leave.\u201d But what changed? Why is Dorsey leaving now? Was he ousted? Or is he \u201cresigning\u201d of his own accord? The answer to those questions varies depending on who you ask.\n\nI spoke to almost half a dozen people familiar with the company\u2019s inner workings, and while they were not directly involved in Dorsey\u2019s \u201cresignation,\u201d these are people who have a deep understanding of the place, and as such theorized that Dorsey is being ousted as CEO, rather than leaving of his own accord. (Twitter itself did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) In 2020, Elliott Management, a hedge fund known for activist investing that controls roughly $48 billion in assets, had purchased $1 billion of Twitter stock and began a campaign to demand changes at Twitter, with a specific goal in mind: getting rid of Dorsey. At the time, Dorsey refused to step down as CEO, using the argument that he was a founder of Twitter, and therefore the only person who could run it, according to people who were familiar with Dorsey\u2019s thinking at the time. Earlier this year, in April, when it was announced that Elliott Management\u2019s activist investor Jesse Cohn was planning to step down from the board of directors, it appeared that Dorsey had survived the Succession-like coup. I then heard rumblings from someone close to Twitter\u2019s board over the summer that there was indeed a CEO search taking place at the company, but I had assumed at the time that it was just theater given that Dorsey has largely been unfireable for the past nearly 16 years, and has always managed to stave off attempts to expel him from the company. In May, Elliott Management increased its holding in Twitter, buying more than $200 million of stock when the company\u2019s value fell by more than 15% following a sluggish earnings report. Looking back now, it appeared that Dorsey\u2019s death knell had been rung.\n\nWhile one former high-level employee at Twitter believes that Dorsey may have indeed decided to step down of his own accord, the employee acknowledged that his resignation was handled in a very peculiar way. Rather than have an overlapping transitionary period, where Dorsey trains his replacement, the switch is happening immediately, which the former employee said was very \u201cweird.\u201d For others, what\u2019s most telling that Dorsey likely didn\u2019t have much of a say in this matter is that he is not only stepping down as CEO, effective immediately, but that he is leaving the board of Twitter in May. In the past, when founders and CEOs step down, they often stick around indefinitely to help guide the direction of a company, given their own understanding of a business. Bill Gates remained on the board of Microsoft about 20 years after he resigned as CEO, and only left when the board opened an investigation into a prior romantic relationship he had with a Microsoft employee that was deemed inappropriate. Eric Schmidt and Larry Page, both of whom served as CEOs of Google, stayed on the board for some time after stepping down (Page is still on the board of Alphabet). Even Twitter\u2019s cofounder, Evan Williams, remained on the board of Twitter for over a decade after he was pushed out by Dorsey. The problem with keeping Dorsey on the board now is that each time he has stepped down in a leadership role at the company in the past, and in turn stayed on the company\u2019s board, he has managed to connive his way back to becoming CEO. The only true way to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen again, one former employee theorized to me, is to cut him out of the company entirely.\n\nAnother person close to the company and to the board told me that the likely scenario of why Dorsey is leaving so abruptly is somewhere in the middle of a resignation and being forced out. \u201cTwo years ago, Jack was friends with everyone on the board,\u201d this person said, and they weren\u2019t going to do anything to hold him accountable for the company\u2019s languid performance over the past few years. \u201cI think it was a bit embarrassing for everyone when Elliott Management showed up and said it wasn\u2019t acceptable for a public company of this size to not have a full-time CEO,\u201d the person told me. \u201cTwo years later, and I think Jack knew that his performance as CEO wasn\u2019t up to par, and that while he had held off being ousted before, he knew that it was only a matter of time before other investors, or his new board, would force him out as CEO.\u201d In other words, Dorsey wasn\u2019t pushed out at this very moment, but he saw the writing on the wall.\n\nFor Dorsey, leaving the company he has spent almost 16 years fighting tooth and nail to stay a part of might be the best thing that could happen to him\u2014and to Twitter. Dorsey\u2019s stature over the past five years has skyrocketed in both wealth and attention. When I first started covering him and the company, Dorsey lived in a tiny studio in the Mission district of San Francisco and was living paycheck to paycheck, barely able to afford new clothes. Now he\u2019s worth nearly an estimated $12 billion, partially from his Twitter shares, his shares in Square, and Bitcoin acquisitions he has made over the years. He no longer socializes with subordinates at Twitter and Square, people he was friends with for many years, but is a part of the elite A-list celebrity set, going boating with Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, or vacationing with Sean Penn and the Israeli venture capitalist Vivi Nevo in Hawaii. And his latest obsession seems to be with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, not necessarily the future of Twitter."}

He joined the company in 2011 before completing his Ph.D. and became a key member of the engineering team that oversaw the company\u2019s advertising technologies.\n\n\u201cI kept nagging him to go ahead and finish his thesis,\u201d Dr. Widom said.\n\nThe ads team was among the first inside Twitter to make extensive use of so-called machine learning, mathematical systems that can learn particular skills by analyzing data. Using these techniques, Mr. Agrawal and his colleagues developed ways to target ads to particular users, which helped raise Twitter\u2019s revenues and his profile.\n\nHe then became a member of what was known as the Twitter Architecture Group, or T.A.G., a team of top engineers who reviewed and improved the company\u2019s projects that were under development.\n\n\u201cHe was on the shortlist of top engineers,\u201d said Krishna Gade, who met Mr. Agrawal when he first interviewed with Twitter. \u201cEven then, he had a lot of influence on the engineering direction of the company.\u201d Mr. Gade left Twitter in 2014.\n\nWhen Mr. Dorsey returned to Twitter as chief executive in 2015, Mr. Agrawal was one of his lieutenants who helped refocus the company\u2019s efforts on the \u201ctimeline\u201d that feeds tweets into a user\u2019s Twitter app. In 2017, Twitter promoted Mr. Agrawal to chief technology officer.\n\n\u201cI would call him pragmatic,\u201d said Kevin Quennesson, who oversaw Twitter\u2019s machine learning efforts at the time. \u201cAs one of the early engineers, he built strong internal relationships over the last decade.\u201d"}

He said she \u201cwill focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Yaccarino announced that she was leaving her role as chairman of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal.\n\n\u201cIt has been an absolute honor to be part of Comcast NBCUniversal and lead the most incredible team,\u201d she said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve transformed our company and the entire industry.\u201d\n\nAs CEO, Yaccarino will face a long list of challenges that have piled up under Musk\u2019s ownership, including an advertiser exodus, service disruptions, regulatory scrutiny and a growing list of rivals. Musk\u2019s controversial policy changes and statements have also alienated some longtime Twitter users.\n\nEven as Musk steps back from the CEO role, he will likely still maintain significant control over the future direction of the company. Musk previously said he would serve as the company\u2019s executive chairman and CTO, as well as being the owner of the platform.\n\nA seasoned media executive\n\nMusk has clashed with mainstream media outlets and also said he hates advertising. But Yaccarino represents both those worlds.\n\nYaccarino has been at NBCUniversal for more than 11 years, returning to the company where she started as a college intern. Before that she was executive vice president/COO of advertising sales, marketing and acquisitions at Turner Broadcasting, which included CNN at that time.\n\nAt NBCUniversal, she oversees a 2,000-member global team, according to her company profile. That would be more people on her team than are left working at Twitter, which Musk said in an interview with the BBC last month is down to 1,500 people after multiple layoffs under his watch.\n\nNBCUniversal\u2019s ad sales team has generated $100 billion in ad sales since she joined in 2011, according to her profile, and forged partnerships with many new media companies including Twitter as well as Apple News, Buzzfeed, Snapchat and YouTube.\n\nLast month she appeared with Musk at an industry conference for a session entitled \u201cTwitter 2.0: From Conversations to Partnerships.\u201d\n\nYaccarino\u2019s most notable achievement at NBCUniversal is creating unified ad sales teams rather than having 15 different sales teams approach the same advertisers.\n\n\u201cWe were difficult to do business with,\u201d she said in an interview with Salesforce describing the consolidation.\n\nThe loss of Yaccarino comes at a bad time for NBCUniversal. Ad revenues are down throughout the media industry, prompting cost cutting and in some cases layoffs across many companies. NBCUniversal has had some job cuts of its own, although not as deep as those at some of its rivals.\n\nMedia companies, including NBC, are scheduled to make \u201cupfront\u201d presentations to advertisers next week in an effort to win ad commitments for later this year. NBC\u2019s session is set for Monday morning.\n\nYaccarino would not be the first or only woman running one of Musk\u2019s companies.\n\nMusk previously tapped, Gwynne Shotwell, to run SpaceX. She is president and COO of the company, while he holds the CEO title. But she\u2019s credited by some in the industry as a key to SpaceX becoming the world\u2019s most successful commercial rocket company.\n\nRobyn Denholm also serves as chairman of Tesla. She assumed that role from Musk when the SEC required him to give up the position after a tweet in which he claimed he had funding secured to take the company private, when he had not yet locked up the financing to do so.\n\nDenholm has kept a low profile at Tesla, not speaking at an investor day earlier this year at which 15 other Tesla executives in addition to Musk spoke\n\nTwitter\u2019s advertiser exodus\n\nThe choice of Yaccarino may hint at Musk recognizing the limitations of his efforts to make Twitter less dependent on advertising.\n\nAd sales represented more than 90% of the company\u2019s revenue before Musk purchased it in October. But many advertisers have fled the site since then.\n\nEarlier this year digital marketing analysis firm Pathmatics by Sensor Tower reported that 625 of the top 1,000 Twitter advertisers, including major brands such as Coca-Cola, Unilever, Jeep, Wells Fargo and Merck, had pulled their ad dollars, based data through January 25. Monthly revenue from those previous top 1,000 advertisers plummeted by more than 60% from October through January 25, from around $127 million to just over $48 million, according to the data.\n\nMany advertisers have been concerned with Musk\u2019s severe staff cuts, the apparent rise of hate speech, and controversial policy decisions, including his move to invite users back to Twitter who had previously been banned.\n\nGeneral Motors said it would pause paying for advertising on Twitter while it evaluates the platform\u2019s \u201cnew direction.\u201d Musk blamed the exodus on \u201cactivist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation.\u201d\n\nMusk has tried to increase revenue by racing to bolster its subscription business, charging for the blue checkmarks that verify a user\u2019s identity, with limited success. As a result, he may have little choice but to revive Twitter\u2019s relationships with advertisers and boost its core advertising business.\n\nMusk has previously spoken about improving ad sales by focusing more on the relevance of its ads.\n\nPressure to find a new Twitter CEO\n\nEver since he first expressed interest in buying Twitter, the share price of Tesla (TSLA) has suffered. Investors have been worried that his fascination with Twitter was distracting him from the challenges facing the electric automaker.\n\nMusk announced the CEO news shortly ahead of Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, which is set for Tuesday.\n\nShares of Tesla closed Thursday down 55% from where they were 13 months ago when his initial purchase of a 9% stake in Twitter was disclosed. Shares of Tesla were up 3% in early trading Friday just after the open, before losing most of that gain.\n\n\u201cWe believe Musk leaving CEO of Twitter earlier than originally thought \u2026 is a positive development for Tesla as well as SpaceX with Musk needing to spend more and more time on these golden child platforms rather than Twitter,\u201d wrote Dan Ives, analyst with Wedbush, in a note to clients Friday.\n\nIt may also be welcome news for Twitter users. Musk promised he would find a new CEO to run Twitter last fall after 57% of those who participated in a Twitter poll he posted voted that he should give up the job. In December he vowed to name a replacement \u201cas soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!\u201d"}

Nickel applies an archaeobotanical lens to her investigations, referencing the past and present with regard to the life cycle of living organisms and to varied forms and functions of ceramics production. Nickel\u2019s work also considers how the micro struggle for survival reflects the macro crises in which we find ourselves today, with climate change and resulting environmental catastrophes top of mind.\n\nNickel\u2019s virtuosic incorporation of diverse ceramic techniques is displayed in Eruptions alongside forward-facing experiments which demonstrate the transformative potential of the medium. Through experimentation in 3D-printing with her collaborator, Michael Zajac, delicate porcelain plumes that burst forth from Eruptions are re-envisioned as other-worldly ink jet prints. Central to the exhibition are limb-like Pyres resembling tree trunks which support miniature forms that reference funerary rituals and provision for the afterlife. Root-like lifelines emerge and stretch skyward suggesting networks of support and the possibility of passage to a new life. An apt creative response to the present time, Eruptions evokes messages of fragility and grief but also hope and resilience.\n\nGrace Nickel is an artist and educator living in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her studio practice focusses on sculptural ceramics and installation. She has won awards in international competitions including the Mino International Ceramics Competition in Japan and the Taiwan Ceramics Biennale, and has had numerous solo exhibitions in Canada including at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, the Winnipeg Art Gallery in Manitoba, the Moose Jaw Museum & Art Gallery in Saskatchewan, and the Art Gallery of Burlington in Ontario. Her work has been widely collected and is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Ceramic Art in Gifu, Japan, the New Taipei City Yingge Ceramics Museum, Taiwan, and the Fule International Ceramic Art Museums project in Fuping, China. Her work has been selected for the Cheongju International Craft Biennale in Korea, and for several NCECA Annual Exhibitions (Philadelphia, Portland). Grace Nickel has completed numerous residencies including at the Pottery Workshop in Jingdezhen, China and the Banff Centre for the Arts in Alberta. She held the position of Adjunct Research Fellow at the Curtin University of Technology in Western Australia and has travelled abroad extensively to present lectures, including recent invitations from the Clayarch Gimhae Museum and AK Ceramics Centre in South Korea, and the Australian Ceramics Triennale in Hobart, Tasmania. Nickel received her BFA from the University of Manitoba and MFA from NSCAD University. She is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of the Arts and currently teaches as Associate Professor at the University of Manitoba School of Art.\n\nEruptions will be open for viewing at Gallery 1C03 on weekdays between 12:00 and 4:00 pm from February 17 until April 8, 2022 (closed Louis Riel Day).

In addition to quite distinct biographies \u2014 McCain, of course, was a war hero and presidential candidate \u2014 their temperaments couldn\u2019t be more different. Unlike Sinema, McCain would talk to the press for hours at a time. And Sinema doesn\u2019t have the fiery, confrontation-loving spirit that leads one to hold court with critics. Agree with him or not, McCain had a way of making people feel heard, even if not convinced.\n\nSinema has always been a woman apart from her party. She reluctantly adopted the label of Democrat only after realizing it was her path to power. And she largely shed that label in her most recent campaign, opting instead to emphasize her independent voice.\n\nWinning reelection in Arizona won\u2019t be easy for any Democrat, but even most of her critics acknowledge Sinema is well positioned for the general election. The real threat may lie in a primary challenge.\n\nHer support within the party is sinking fast, with recent polls showing her approval rating among Democrats at 25 percent. But her reelection is still three years away, and if she ultimately helps pass Biden\u2019s legislative agenda, rank-and-file voters could grudgingly return.\n\nBut what if she doesn\u2019t, and they don\u2019t? Some Arizona politicos are increasingly floating the idea that she could sidestep her problem with the base entirely by formally quitting the party and running as an independent.\n\n\u201cBy reregistering independent and running for reelection as such, Sinema would take the club out of the hands of progressive hardliners,\u201d Arizona Republic columnist Robert Robb wrote recently. \u201cThe threat to primary her would evaporate. In fact, the harder left the Democratic nominee for the seat turns out to be, the better for Sinema\u2019s chances in a three-way general election.\u201d\n\nThat still sounds like a fantasy to most in the political chattering class here. But it\u2019s one that Democratic state Rep. Robert Meza, one of Sinema\u2019s closest allies from the state legislature and still a supporter, says is possible. In fact, he sees it as the most likely path to victory for Sinema."}
{"archive_url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/politics/kyrsten-sinema-leaves-democratic-party/index.html", "source_text": "Kyrsten Sinema leaving the Democratic Party and registering as an independent\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nArizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is leaving the Democratic Party and registering as a political independent, she told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in an exclusive TV interview.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve registered as an Arizona independent. I know some people might be a little bit surprised by this, but actually, I think it makes a lot of sense,\u201d Sinema said in a Thursday interview with Tapper in her Senate office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never fit neatly into any party box. I\u2019ve never really tried. I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she added. \u201cRemoving myself from the partisan structure \u2013 not only is it true to who I am and how I operate, I also think it\u2019ll provide a place of belonging for many folks across the state and the country, who also are tired of the partisanship.\u201d\n\nSinema\u2019s move away from the Democratic Party is unlikely to change the power balance in the next Senate. Democrats will have a narrow 51-49 majority that includes two independents who caucus with them: Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine.\n\nWhile Sanders and King formally caucus with Democrats, Sinema declined to explicitly say that she would do the same. She did note, however, that she expects to keep her committee assignments \u2013 a signal that she doesn\u2019t plan to upend the Senate composition, since Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer controls committee rosters for Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen I come to work each day, it\u2019ll be the same,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cI\u2019m going to still come to work and hopefully serve on the same committees I\u2019ve been serving on and continue to work well with my colleagues at both political parties.\u201d\n\nBut Sinema\u2019s decision to become a political independent makes official what\u2019s long been an independent streak for the Arizona senator, who began her political career as a member of the Green Party before being elected as a Democrat to the US House in 2012 and US Senate in 2018. Sinema has prided herself on being a thorn in the side of Democratic leaders, and her new nonpartisan affiliation will further free her to embrace an against-the-grain status in the Senate, though it raises new questions about how she \u2013 and Senate Democrats \u2013 will approach her reelection in 2024 with liberals already mulling a challenge.\n\nSinema wrote an op-ed in the Arizona Republic released Friday explaining her decision, noting that her approach in the Senate has \u201cupset partisans in both parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen politicians are more focused on denying the opposition party a victory than they are on improving Americans\u2019 lives, the people who lose are everyday Americans,\u201d Sinema wrote.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I have joined the growing numbers of Arizonans who reject party politics by declaring my independence from the broken partisan system in Washington.\u201d\n\nSinema is up for reelection in 2024 and liberals in Arizona are already floating potential challengers, including Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, who said earlier this year that some Democratic senators have urged him to run against Sinema.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Senator Sinema is once again putting her own interests ahead of getting things done for Arizonans,\u201d Gallego said in a statement following Sinema\u2019s announcement.\n\nSinema declined to address questions about her reelection bid in the interview with Tapper, saying that simply isn\u2019t her focus right now.\n\nShe also brushed aside criticism she may face for the decision to leave the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just not worried about folks who may not like this approach,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cWhat I am worried about is continuing to do what\u2019s right for my state. And there are folks who certainly don\u2019t like my approach, we hear about it a lot. But the proof is in the pudding.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats shrug off news of Sinema\u2019s announcement\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called Sinema a \u201ckey partner\u201d following her decision and said the White House has \u201cevery reason to expect that we will continue to work successfully with her.\u201d\n\nSources familiar with the matter tell CNN that Sinema gave the White House a heads up that she was leaving the Democratic Party. Schumer said in a statement he also was aware of Sinema\u2019s bombshell announcement ahead of Friday morning.\n\n\u201cShe asked me to keep her committee assignments and I agreed,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cKyrsten is independent; that\u2019s how she\u2019s always been. I believe she\u2019s a good and effective Senator and am looking forward to a productive session in the new Democratic majority Senate.\u201d\n\nSchumer also outlined how he did not expect Sinema\u2019s decision to impact Democrats\u2019 plans for next year, saying in his statement, \u201cWe will maintain our new majority on committees, exercise our subpoena power, and be able to clear nominees without discharge votes.\u201d\n\nThe Biden White House is offering a muted reaction Friday morning and insisting that they expect to continue having a productive working relationship with the senator.\n\nOne White House official tells CNN that the move \u201cdoesn\u2019t change much\u201d other than Sinema\u2019s own reelection calculations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with her effectively on a lot of major legislation from CHIPS to the bipartisan infrastructure law,\u201d the official said. The White House, for now, has \u201cevery reason to expect that will continue,\u201d they added.\n\nSinema has long been the source of a complex convergence of possibility, frustration and confusion inside the White House.\n\n\u201cRubik\u2019s cube, I guess?\u201d was how one former senior White House official described the Arizona senator who has played a central role in President Joe Biden\u2019s largest legislative wins and also some of his biggest agenda disappointments.\n\nThere was no major push to get Sinema to change her mind, a White House official said, noting that it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference.\n\n\u201cNothing about the last two years indicates a major effort would\u2019ve made helped \u2013 the exact opposite actually,\u201d a White House official said.\n\nThe most urgent near-term effort was to quietly find out what it meant for their newly expanded Senate majority, officials said.\n\nWhile there were still clear details to figure out about process, \u201cI think people exhaled when we had a better understanding of what she meant,\u201d one source familiar with the discussion said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d that \u201cSenator Sinema has always had an independent streak,\u201d adding that \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is going to shake things up quite like everyone thinks.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cSenator Sinema has been an independent in all intents and purposes.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s OK if some people aren\u2019t comfortable with that approach\u2019\n\nSinema and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin have infuriated liberals at various points over the past two years, standing in the way of Biden\u2019s agenda at a time when Democrats controlled the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSinema and Manchin used their sway in the current 50-50 Senate \u2013 where any single Democrat could derail a bill \u2013 to influence a host of legislation, especially the massive $3.5 trillion Build Back Better bill that Biden proposed last year. Sinema\u2019s objections to increasing the corporate tax rate during the initial round of negotiations over the legislation last year particularly rankled liberals.\n\nWhile Sinema was blindsided by the surprise deal that Manchin cut with Schumer in July on major health care and energy legislation, she ultimately backed the smaller spending package that Biden signed into law before the election.\n\nBoth Manchin and Sinema also opposed changes to the Senate\u2019s filibuster rules despite pressure from their Senate colleagues and Biden to change them. After a vote against filibuster changes in January, the Arizona Democratic Party\u2019s executive board censured Sinema.\n\nSinema has been in the middle of several significant bipartisan bills that were passed since Biden took office. She pointed to that record as evidence that her approach has been an effective one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been honored to lead historic efforts, from infrastructure, to gun violence prevention, to protecting religious liberty and helping LGBT families feel secure, to the CHIPs and science bill to the work we\u2019ve done on veterans\u2019 issues,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThe list is really long. And so I think that the results speak for themselves. It\u2019s OK if some people aren\u2019t comfortable with that approach.\u201d\n\nSinema\u2019s announcement comes just days after Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock won reelection in Georgia, securing Democrats a 51st Senate seat that frees them from reliance on Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tiebreaking vote.\n\nSinema declined to address questions about whether she would support Biden for president in 2024, and she also said she\u2019s not thinking about whether a strong third party should emerge in the US.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."}

Many Instagram users went to the comment section to share their thoughts about the weird video. \"Respectfully I have no idea what this post means,\" one user said.\n\nAnother aspect of the video that stirred viewers' curiosity was the size of the bed shown. \"Wtf size of bed is that?

Another commented, \"All I can think about is trying to get a fitted sheet on this bed.\"\n\nKanye has previously shared rather provocative images of Bianca. In January 2024, he posted a photo of Bianca cooking in a daring ensemble with a black latex mask covering her head. He captioned the photo, \"cream of wheat,\" but later deleted the post.\n\nEarlier that month, in honor of the New Year, he posted another scandalous photo of his wife with the caption \"No pants this year,\" while leaving little to the imagination.\n\nBianca has been garnering attention lately for her bold fashion choices beyond just their doorstep.

He\u2019s a renowned plant scientist who grew up in India, was educated in Australia and has worked at four of Canada\u2019s leading research universities. Having spent much of the past decade as president or principal of a major university campus, he\u2019s ready and excited to help lead the Dalhousie community into its third century.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am honoured and humbled by the opportunity to serve as the 12th president and vice-chancellor of Dalhousie University,\u201d says Dr. Saini, who will begin his five-year term on January 1, 2020. \u201cThe university\u2019s students, faculty and staff are proudly devoted to the synergy between world-class education and a rich tradition of outstanding research and scholarship. I am thrilled at being given the chance to be part of writing the next chapter of this compelling story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Saini was the unanimous choice of the search committee, chaired by Board of Governors Chair Lawrence Stordy and consisting of representatives from the Board, Senate, students and administration.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe search committee was thrilled and thoroughly impressed by the quality and quantity of candidates who were interested in this opportunity, from around the world \u2014 a testament to Dalhousie\u2019s growing national and international reputation,\u201d says Stordy.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven among this competition, however, Deep truly stood apart. He\u2019s a warm, genuine and inspiring individual ready to build on Dal\u2019s 200 years of achievement and chart a course towards even greater success in our third century ahead.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Saini follows Dalhousie\u2019s 11th President and Vice-Chancellor Richard Florizone, who served from 2013 until 2018, and Peter MacKinnon, presently serving as president in an interim capacity. With MacKinnon\u2019s term set to conclude at the end of June, the Board of Governors will review options for interim leadership for the remainder of 2019 in the coming weeks.\n\nMore info: Presidential Search website\n\n\n\nA global journey\n\n\n\nDr. Saini is not the first Dalhousie president to be born outside of North America; in this respect, he follows inaugural president Thomas McCulloch (Scotland) and Howard Clark (New Zealand). But having grown up in India, a generation removed from poverty, his path to Dalhousie is quite unlike anyone else who\u2019s taken up the mantle of the presidency.\n\nInspired by his father\u2019s example \u2014 a man whose own educational journey transformed his life and that of his family forever \u2014 Dr. Saini pursued higher education, studying botany at the Punjab Agricultural University in Ludhiana, India before moving to Australia to complete a PhD in Plant Physiology at the University of Adelaide. Following graduation, Dr. Saini and his family relocated to Canada to take on a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Alberta. It was the start of an accomplished academic career that would make him a leading researcher in plant biology, eventually becoming director of the Institute de recherche en biologie v\u00e9g\u00e9tale (Plant Biology Research Institute) \u2014 a leading research establishment at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Saini moved into his first senior administrative role, becoming dean of the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo. There, he launched several new programs and increased both operating and facilities funding. He then joined the University of Toronto as principal of the university\u2019s Mississauga campus, leading major internationalization efforts, overseeing a significant facilities expansion and increassing faculty complement by nearly 100 professors.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the three-and-a-half years prior to joining the Dal community this January, he has served as vice-chancellor and president of the University of Canberra, a young university of comparable size and international ranking to Dalhousie. There, he\u2019s led the development and implementation of a new strategic plan positioning the school as a national leader in professional education and experiential learning, mission-oriented research as well as in equity, diversity, inclusion and access.\n\n\n\nHe is fluent in four different languages (English, French, Hindi and his native Punjabi), with a working knowledge of a fifth (Urdu). His awards and recognitions also speak to his diverse impact, including honours from the Canadian Society of Plant Physiologists, Nanjing University, the Sikh Foundation of Canada, the Royal Society of New South Wales, the Punjab Academy of Sciences and the Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce. He was featured in India Abroad's \"2011 Power List\" and is the recipient of a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived a myriad of experiences during my journey \u2014 from sitting cross-legged on a dusty school floor to the administrative \u2018cabinet\u2019 of a global top-20 university, and now to the helm of a rapidly rising young institution in Australia,\u201d says Dr. Saini. \u201cBut the opportunity to return to Canada and become part of Dalhousie\u2019s journey as its president is one I simply could not pass up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired by Dalhousie\n\n\n\nSo why Dalhousie? Well, for one, he says he\u2019s long admired Dal for its quest for global excellence while remaining, first and foremost, a university for its community.\n\n\n\n\u201cDalhousie\u2019s singular commitment to its anchor role in the region\u2019s economic and social development is fittingly matched to its lofty national and global aspirations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a balance that I have espoused throughout my career and will form the cornerstone of my leadership at Dal.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also inspired by Dalhousie\u2019s extensive efforts in recent years to better support a more diverse, inclusive university community.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving come from a humble background where nothing could have predicted that I would someday lead one of Canada\u2019s top universities, Dal\u2019s founding idea of a university that is \u2018open to all\u2019 resonates particularly close to my heart. I can\u2019t wait to get down to work to bring this idea to life in its modern context, positioning Dal\u2019s core value of commitment to equity, diversity, inclusion and access as its key differentiator and competitive advantage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also sees Dal as a \u201crising star\u201d in mission-oriented research \u2014 but one which puts students at the forefront of that mission.\n\n\n\n\u201cStudents are at the heart of the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of a university,\u201d he says. \u201cBuilding upon Dal\u2019s national and international reputation for rich student experience, I look forward to a deep engagement with students, faculty, staff and community to position Dal as the national leader in delivering value to our students and offering a transformative educational and life experience on our four campuses.\u201d\n\n\n\nGetting to know one another\n\n\n\nThat engagement will begin in early June, when Dr. Saini is hoping to make his first visit to campus as President-Elect. It will be a first chance for some in the Dal community to get to know a person who loves listening to music and cooking, and who is a lifelong advocate for fitness and athletics: he played field hockey and track-and-field as a student-athlete, and is now an avid golfer and expects to be a familiar face at Dalplex.\n\n\n\nWhen he moves to campus in January, he will be joined by his wife, Rani. The family also has two grown daughters, Preety and Kavita, and two grandchildren. Dr. Saini says he and his wife are excited to become part of the Halifax community and experience Atlantic Canada to the fullest.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have visited this lovely part of Canada several times and we are thrilled to have the opportunity to now fully immerse ourselves in the life here,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nStordy, having gotten to know Dr. Saini through the search process, is excited about what the future holds for him at Dalhousie.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe joins Dalhousie at a time of tremendous momentum: record enrolment and fundraising, significant renewal of our campuses, and a strong leadership team in place across the university,\u201d he says. \u201cUnder Dr. Saini\u2019s leadership, I\u2019m certain these successes will be just a taste of what Dalhousie\u2019s third century has in store.\u201d"}

Climate change is a grave and mounting threat to our wellbeing and a healthy planet.\n\nWe are now busy working to finalise the Synthesis Report with which we will complete the Sixth Assessment Report.\n\nThe climate science is clear; our Physical Science Basis report concludes that:\n\nIt is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change and human influence is making extreme climate events, including heat waves, heavy rainfall, and droughts, more frequent and severe.\n\nHuman activities have warmed the planet at a rate not seen in at least the past 2000 years and we are on course to reaching global warming of 1.5\u00b0C within the next two decades.\n\nOur report on Impact, Adaptation and Vulnerability shows that these levels of warming are a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet and that the next few years offer a rapidly closing window to realize a sustainable, livable future for all.\n\nClimate impacts and risks are becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Multiple climate hazards will occur simultaneously. Climate risks will interact with other threats to compound the overall risk. Risks will cascade across sectors and regions.\n\nEven temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00b0C warming will result in additional severe impacts, some of which will be irreversible.\n\nWe are not on track to achieve a climate resilient, sustainable world. Action on adaptation has increased but progress is uneven and we are not adapting fast enough.\n\nAs the mitigation to climate change report concluded, we are not on track to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Average annual GHG emissions during the last two decades were the highest in human history.\n\nClimate change is already affecting every region on Earth, in multiple ways. The changes we experience will increase with further warming.\n\nHumanity is running out of time to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0 Cover pre-industrial levels\n\nYes, colleagues, we are at crossroads. Our actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to increasing climate risks.\n\nThe IPCC reports throughout this entire cycle focus on solutions.\n\nThere are feasible and effective options we can take to reduce the risks to people and nature, but their effectiveness decreases with increasing warming.\n\nWorldwide action to achieve climate resilient and sustainable development is more urgent than previously assessed.\n\nClimate action has been taken in many countries. There are policies, regulations and market instruments that are proving effective. If these are scaled up along with the climate finance and applied more widely and equitably, they can support deep emissions reductions and stimulate innovation.\n\nMoreover, our latest report shows that there are options available now in all sectors that can at least halve emissions by 2030.\n\nWe have the tools and know-how required to limit warming. The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future.\n\nIn concluding, I wish to remind you, that the next few years will be critical, but there are ways to improve our chances of success. International cooperation is key to achieving ambitious climate goals.\n\nHuman-induced climate change is the result of more than a century of unsustainable energy and land use, lifestyles, and patterns of consumption and production.\n\nClimate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the world, and results in severe impacts in nature.\n\nAccelerated and equitable climate action in mitigating, and adapting to, climate change impacts is critical to sustainable development.\n\nI invite you to reflect on the knowledge we have developed so far which today is stronger than ever to build the decisions to address the climate challenge.\n\nThank you."}

Skea was elected by 90 votes to 69 in a run-off with Thelma Krug.\n\n\u201cClimate change is an existential threat to our planet. My ambition is to lead an IPCC that is truly representative and inclusive, an IPCC looking to the future while exploiting the opportunities that we have in the present. An IPCC where everyone feels valued and heard,\u201d said Skea in his address to the delegates attending the IPCC elections.\n\n\u201cIn this, I will pursue three priorities \u2013 improving inclusiveness and diversity, shielding scientific integrity and policy relevance of IPCC assessment reports, and making the effective use of the best available science on climate change. My actions as the Chair of the IPCC will ensure that these ambitions are realized.\u201d\n\nThe election took place at the headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme in Nairobi, Kenya, where the IPCC is holding its 59th Session. Elections for other positions in the IPCC Bureau, including the Co-Chairs of the IPCC Working Groups, will take place from 26-28 July.\n\nFour candidates ran for the Chair of the IPCC. These were the first elections in the history of the IPCC with women candidates running for this position.\n\nJim Skea, aged 69, is Professor of Sustainable Energy at Imperial College in London. During the IPCC\u2019s just completed sixth assessment cycle, Skea was the Co-Chair of Working Group III, assessing the mitigation of climate change. Most of his career, spreading over decades, has been dedicated to ensuring that the challenges of climate change are understood, and actions to avert them are taken.\n\nJim Skea\u2019s full CV can be found here.\n\nThe election of the new IPCC Bureau, which will have 34 members, including the Chair, opens the way for work to start on the IPCC\u2019s Seventh Assessment Report, expected to be completed in the coming five to seven years. The Panel will also elect the 12 members of the Task Force Bureau on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI).\n\nThe IPCC completed its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) in March 2023. The key findings of the AR6 Synthesis Report are:\n\nThe pace and scale of climate action are insufficient to tackle climate change.\n\nMultiple, feasible, and effective options are available to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to human-caused climate change.\n\nEnabling conditions include finance, technology, capacity building, and international cooperation.\n\nThe candidates for IPCC Chair, with the countries that nominated them, included:\n\nThelma Krug (Brazil)\n\nDebra Roberts (South Africa)\n\nJim Skea (United Kingdom)\n\nJean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium)\n\n-ENDS-\n\nFor further information, contact:\n\nIPCC Press Office, Email: ipcc-media@wmo.int\n\nAndrej Mahecic, +41 22 730 8516 or Werani Zabula, +41 22 730 8120\n\nNotes for editors\n\nWhat is the IPCC?\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the UN body for assessing the science related to climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide political leaders with periodic scientific assessments concerning climate change, its implications and risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation strategies. In the same year the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by the WMO and UNEP in jointly establishing the IPCC. It has 195 member states.\n\nThousands of people from all over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC. For the assessment reports, experts volunteer their time as IPCC authors to assess the thousands of scientific papers published each year to provide a comprehensive summary of what is known about the drivers of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and how adaptation and mitigation can reduce those risks.\n\nThe IPCC has three working groups: Working Group I, dealing with the physical science basis of climate change; Working Group II, dealing with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and Working Group III, dealing with the mitigation of climate change. It also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories that develops methodologies for measuring emissions and removals.\n\nIPCC assessments provide governments, at all levels, with scientific information that they can use to develop climate policies. IPCC assessments are a key input into the international negotiations to tackle climate change. IPCC reports are drafted and reviewed in several stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency.\n\nAbout the Sixth Assessment Cycle\n\nComprehensive scientific assessment reports are published every 6 to 7 years; the latest, the Sixth Assessment Report, was completed in 2023 and will provide the main scientific input to global stocktake process under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nIn the sixth assessment cycle the Panel produced three Special Reports, a Methodology Report and the Sixth Assessment Report.\n\nThe Working Group I contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis was released on 9 August 2021. The Working Group II contribution, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, was released on 28 February 2022. The Working Group III contribution, Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, was released on 4 April 2022 and the Synthesis Report on 20 March 2023.\n\nThe Synthesis Report to the Sixth Assessment Report, distills and integrates the findings of the three Working Group assessments as well as the three Special Reports released in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe IPCC special reports have focused on more specific issues:\n\nGlobal Warming of 1.5\u00b0C, an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty was launched in October 2018.\n\nClimate Change and Land, an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems was launched in August 2019, and the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate was released in September 2019.\n\nAdditionally, in May 2019, the IPCC released the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, an update to the methodology used by governments to estimate their greenhouse gas emissions and removals.\n\nFor more information visit www.ipcc.ch.\n\nThe website includes outreach materials including videos about the IPCC and video recordings from outreach events conducted as webinars or live-streamed events.\n\nMost videos published by the IPCC can be found on our YouTube channel."}

This is far from the first time they've been spotted by paparazzi: They were photographed as far back as July 2022 and as recently as earlier this February, going for a coffee run after the Grammys.\n\nWhile neither Miranda nor Mendes have commented on dating rumors (and a source told Entertainment Tonight in March 2023 that there's no truth to them), Miranda does have years-long history with Mendes as a chiropractor he works with first and foremost. Here, what to know about her and her history with the 25-year-old singer.\n\nFRDO, SPOT // BACKGRID Shawn Mendes and Dr. Jocelyne Miranda on February 21, 2023.\n\nMiranda is a chiropractor based in Los Angeles who also works with singers on diaphragm/breathing techniques.\n\nOn her website, Miranda describes herself as having over 20 years experience in the \ufb01eld of chiropractic and rehabilitation. \u201cHer approach is based on a detailed and speci\ufb01c bio-mechanical evaluation combined with Joint and Soft Tissue Manipulation techniques such as Graston and ART (Active Release Technique), among others,\u201d her site detailed. \u201cShe is a Specialist in Spine and Extremity Adjustments (CCEP: Certi\ufb01ed Chiropractic Extremity Practitioner) and uses Craneo Sacral Therapy and Diaphragm/Breathing techniques for singers with DNS rehabilitation protocols.\u201d\n\nMiranda's celebrity clients include Mendes, Justin Bieber, and Mendes' ex-girlfriend Hailey Bieber.\n\nHer site also notes that Miranda worked with Mendes on his tour from 2018 to 2019, giving \u201cpersonal assessment and treatment pre/post-show.\u201d She is currently working with Justin and Hailey Bieber, per her site, on \u201chealth and biomechanic advice and treatments.\u201d\n\nMiranda's experience with Mendes goes back years: Her first listed work with him was in 2018 for the iHeartRadio Music Festival. She also assisted him during his May 2019 Saturday Night Live and Met Gala appearances, August 2019 MTV Video Music Awards appearance, and helped both Mendes and his ex-girlfriend Camila Cabello on their American Music Award performance in November 2019.\n\nPhotos of her with her celebrity clients, including Mendes, appear on her Instagram.\n\nIt's worth noting that Mendes previously dated Hailey Bieber in 2017 to May 2018, when Hailey was already working with Miranda. There's a possibility Hailey may have introduced them, as Mendes started working with Miranda in May 2018.\n\nMiranda has regularly shown support for Mendes on her Instagram since they started working together.\n\nFrom birthday posts to just general shots expressing how proud she is of Mendes, Miranda has documented their professional relationship with regularity. Mendes has liked the posts. Miranda does this with many of her celebrity clients ,though, using her Instagram to showcase her work and the places her job takes her.\n\n\n\nMiranda's shared her first post with Mendes in May 2018, which he liked. She shared a birthday tribute to him that August.\n\nDating rumors about Mendes and Miranda have been fueled by multiple paparazzi sightings, going as far back as July 2022.\n\nNeither Mendes, who is publicly single following his November 2021 breakup from Camila Cabello, nor Miranda have spoken out on the months-long romantic chatter about the two. On February 19, DeuxMoi suggested that Mendes may be involved with someone else, claiming the singer was spotted on a \u201cdate\u201d-like outing with Sabrina Carpenter, but of course, DeuxMoi is unverified celeb gossip.\n\nMendes and Miranda were photographed together just days later on February 21.\n\nDating rumors for Miranda and Mendes go back to July 2022, when the two were photographed getting lunch together, according to Daily Mail.\n\nTheir February 21 hike led multiple outlets to report about their rumored romantic relationship. The photo agency that published the photos reported that the two laughed when they were called \u201ca fit couple\u201d while on the outing.\n\nOn January 16, the Daily Mail ran photographs of Miranda and Mendes arriving at his house together. Paparazzi also captured them getting coffee on February 6, \u201cafter hitting a few Grammys after parties together,\u201d and grocery shopping at Erewhon on November 10, 2022.\n\nRegardless of their romantic status, it's clear Mendes and Miranda are close.\n\nMendes spoke to WSJ magazine in February 2023 about how his decision to cancel his Wonder Tour last year to focus on his mental health led him to lean on his support system, a group of which Miranda appears to be a member. \u201cThe process was very difficult,\u201d Mendes said, via Entertainment Tonight. \u201cA lot of doing therapy, a lot of trying to understand how I was feeling and what was making me feel that way. And then doing the work to help myself and heal. And also leaning on people in my life to help a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of work, but I think the last year and a half has been the most eye-opening and growing and beautiful and just healing process of my life,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m also really grateful for all the people that were so accepting and loving and kind and understanding. And it just really made me see how culture is really starting to get to a place where mental health is really becoming a priority.\u201d\n\nIn March 2023, a source said that Mendes was involved with Sabrina Carpenter...and never dated Miranda.\n\nFinally after nearly a year, a source spoke about the nature of Mendes' relationship with Miranda to Entertainment Tonight. It was just professional. \u201cHe was never dating Dr. Jocelyn Miranda and it has never been romantic between them,\u201d the source said.\n\nMendes and Carpenter, meanwhile, \u201care seeing each other,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey have been hanging out a lot and trying to keep things low-key. They were at a birthday party together a couple weeks ago and were cute together. Shawn is happy.\u201d\n\nIn May 2023, when Mendes' romance with ex Camila Cabello was back on, he and Miranda were photographed hugging.\n\nMiranda and Mendes showed a little genuinely friendly affection when they were photographed hugging on May 5. Daily Mail ran photos here.\n\nMiranda had arrived at Mendes' house to give him a private chiropractic session. He embraced her to say hello and helped her bring in her equipment. Outlets noted at the time that Mendes had been spotted days before with Cabello, showing legitimate PDA. Cabello and Mendes' rekindled romance ended in June, with The Sun first reporting the breakup on June 7.\n\nIn August 2023, after Mendes' romance with Cabello had ended again, he and Miranda were photographed on a hike together.\n\nMendes' romance with Cabello fizzled out once more, but he and Miranda remain close. Paparazzi photographed them on August 9, 2023, taking a hike together in Eaton Canyon trail in Pasadena. Mendes removed his shirt at one point, an understandable move given the summer weather. The two friends did not show any PDA or evidence of anything romantic happening. You can see photos here.\n\nIn December 2023, Mendes and Miranda seen again amidst rumors Mendes is dating Charlie Travers.\n\nOn Saturday, December 16, Mendes was seen again with Miranda in Los Angeles out shopping, both of them dressed in black. The singer was smiling and he walked and chatted with his chiropractor.\n\nEarlier the same month, Mendes and Big Brother alum Charlie Travers reportedly started living together at his home in L.A., and they were seen in November at WeHo restaurant E.P. & L.P. and then on the beach in Malibu."}

He has served as conference secretary for the past three years.\n\nHe was ordained a priest in the Diocese of Cleveland in 1977. In the Vatican diplomatic corps, he served as secretary in the apostolic nunciature in Ivory Coast and later in Paraguay. From 1990 to 2001 he was chief of cabinet to Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Vatican secretary of state under St. John Paul II and desk officer for Central America.\n\nArchbishop Lori was appointed the 16th archbishop of Baltimore by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. He is the former chairman of the U.S.C.C.B.\u2019s Committee on Doctrine and its Ad Hoc Committee for Religious Liberty. He began a three-year term as the bishops\u2019 pro-life chairman at the end of the USCCB\u2019s 2021 fall assembly.\n\nIn a keynote address opening the annual meeting, the apostolic nuncio to the United States Archbishop Christophe Pierre challenged U.S. bishops to embrace the lessons emerging from the synodal process, to allow the U.S. church to become a listening church, one in dialogue with culture, asking: \u201cWhere are we and more importantly where are we going?\u201d\n\nArchbishop Broglio, 70, worked in the Vatican diplomatic corps before being named the head of the military archdiocese in 2007.\n\nArchbishop Pierre told the bishops assembled for their annual meeting in Baltimore on Nov. 15 that the words and example of Pope Francis, approaching the 10th anniversary of his papacy, could help guide them in answering those questions, reminding them of the pope\u2019s admonition that a church that \u201cdoes not go out of herself\u201d risks becoming inward, self-referential, risks \u201cbecoming sick.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Pierre said, \u201cThe Holy Father challenges us not only to accompany others in their spiritual journey but in their human journey\u2026aware of the brokenness of life.\u201d\n\nThe church, he said, must be more deeply committed to its mission in the world than to old structures that may come to hinder it. The church exists to evangelize, he said, \u201cto go forth\u201d and break out of its comfort zones, reach out to \u201cthe abandoned and forgotten\u201d and express its tenderness to them.\n\n\u201cDoes the church in the United States understand herself in this way?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo we go forth and take the initiative\u2026do we accompany others showing patience? Do our churches demonstrate the joy of a eucharistic community?\u201d\n\nArchbishop Pierre said, \u201cThe Holy Father challenges us not only to accompany others in their spiritual journey but in their human journey\u2026aware of the brokenness of life.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. church, he said, is \u201cbeginning to think and lead in a synodal way, learning how to listen\u201d and learning patience with dialogue\u2014a lesson for the broader society. \u201cMuch of the division in this country\u2014in families and communities and even in the church,\u201d he said, \u201ccomes from the fact that we have forgotten how to be with one another and to speak with one another.\u201d\n\nIn his last address as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholc Bishops, Archbishop Jose Gomez seemed to find answers for some of the papal nuncio\u2019s questions. Touched by the conversations with parents and young people across the country he has had over the last three years, Catholics \u201ctrying to make Jesus part of their lives\u2026gives me hope for the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not inevitable that our country will fall into secularism,\u201d he said.\n\nThe noisy fractiousness of our current time has been experienced before, he said, noting that his personal hero Dorothy Day, writing in the 1940s, worried over how the print and radio media of her era seemed to be conspiring then to overcome faith and holiness.\n\n\u201cLong before Big Tech and the internet,\u201d he said, \u201cThe challenges we face today are nothing new.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat the soul is to the body, the church is to the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenges of this age are spiritual,\u201d Archbishop Gomez said. \u201cAll parts of the church\u201d clergy to religious men and women and to lay people, \u201care being called to a deeper conversation. All parts of the church are being called to open the door to Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nIn his address, Archbishop Pierre agreed that the responsibility to evangelize was shared by all the people of God.\n\nThe church in the United States has been \u201cprophetic in its openness to those suffering to those suffering a human catastrophe at the border\u201d and in defense of the unborn and now in \u201cPost-Dobbs\u201d in walking with women in need, Archbishop Pierre said, referring to the U.S. church\u2019s expanding efforts to support women facing unplanned pregnancies.\n\n\u201cThe church in the United States can be a protagonist in building civilization,\u201d Archbishop Pierre said, \u201cbuilders of communion and stewards of life and creation.\u201d The U.S. church, he said, \u201ccan offer the people of God an integral vision of man and his place in the world.\u201d\n\nMaterial from Catholic News Service was used in this report."}

This morning, the popular accelerator program and investment firm is announcing that it has promoted longtime partner Geoff Ralston to president.\n\nIt\u2019s an unsurprising choice for YC, an organization that employs roughly 60 people, many of whom have been affiliated with it in one way or another for years. When its founders, Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston, first looked for someone to lead the rocket ship they had built, they quickly identified Altman, who was part of the first class of Y Combinator and who later helped them advise YC startups.\n\nSimilarly, Graham has known Ralston for 20 years; they met at Yahoo, where both landed through acquisitions. Graham sold his company, Viaweb, a web-based application that allowed users to build and host their own online stores, to Yahoo in 1998. Ralston built RocketMail, one of the first web mail services, which in 1997 became Yahoo Mail.\n\nRalston later logged time as the CEO of a streaming music service, Lala Media, that sold to Apple in 2009. He then co-founded \u2014 with Graham\u2019s help \u2014 Imagine K12, an edtech accelerator that funded companies like ClassDojo, among others, before Ralston and Graham decided to merge it into YC in 2016.\n\nWe talked with both Ralston and Altman last night about the appointment, and Ralston sounded very enthusiastic. \u201cFollowing P.G. and Sam is a daunting but incredibly exciting prospect for me. I feel like I was made for this job.\u201d\n\nSlightly more surprising: As part of the announcement, Altman, who was named chairman of YC as he was transitioning out the door a few months ago, tells us now that he will no longer hold that title, that he will instead be an advisor and \u201cavailable\u201d to YC. He said that his heart now is really with OpenAI (more on that here). He also wants to give Ralston space, saying that \u201cone thing that P.G. did for me was just make it very clear [to everyone] that I was in charge. My shoes aren\u2019t as big to fill, but I want to do the same for Geoff.\u201d\n\nWe asked Ralston last night if Altman had given him any advice \u2014 or shared horror stories. (\u201cI didn\u2019t shy away from the hard parts, but the good parts are really obvious, including YC\u2019s impact and the quality of people we work with,\u201d said Altman.)\n\nWe also asked if there was anything Ralston might want to change about YC straightaway, knowing the organization as well as he does. On this front, both men noted that they have worked closely for years (and known each other for ten), with Ralston adding that under his leadership, \u201cThe job should look much the same; so much of YC works incredibly well.\u201d\n\nAs for the process involved in selecting Ralston, YC isn\u2019t saying exactly. The broader point, apparently, is that he\u2019s the right person for the job. \u201cThe whole partnership was excited about this,\u201d said Altman. \u201cA number of people could do the job [inside of YC]. I think Geoff will be exceptional.\u201d\n\nRalston has personally invested in more than 100 companies, says YC. He\u2019s also the longest tenured partner, along with Gmail creator Paul Buchheit, who joined YC in 2010.\n\nMost recently, he helped scale YC\u2019s free online program, Startup School. Below is one piece of related programming from last fall, with Ralston talking about fundraising fundamentals."}

Come January, Tan will replace president Geoff Ralston, who took the mantle in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis is a community where people\u2019s dreams, more or less, are fulfilled in a lot of ways,\u201d Tan tells Forbes in an exclusive interview. \u201cThe chance to come back and help make that happen is a one in 10 billion lifetimes kind of thing.\u201d\n\nWhen he takes over the top job at Y Combinator, Tan will step away from a full-time role at Initialized Capital, the firm he created with Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian in 2012. An early investor in cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, grocery delivery service Instacart and supply chain software unicorn Flexport, Tan has appeared on the Forbes Midas List for the past four years, most recently ranking at No. 28. He debuted at No. 4 on the inaugural Forbes Midas Seed List in 2022.\n\nBy selecting Tan to lead YC, the accelerator\u2019s board brings one of its most prominent alumni back into the fold. Tan and Ohanian started investing as Initialized in 2011 while still partners at YC, before stepping away to focus on the firm full time. (Ohanian later departed to launch a new VC firm, Seven Seven Six, last year.) But Tan\u2019s ties to the accelerator have remained deep: The internal directory he built, cheekily called Bookface, remains a key piece of the network that YC offers its entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cI have never stopped thinking of Garry as part of YC,\u201d outgoing president Ralston tells Forbes. \u201cIt feels like he\u2019s coming home.\u201d\n\nTan will begin leading Y Combinator at a transitional moment for the accelerator, among the world\u2019s largest and most influential with alumni including home rental service Airbnb, payments leader Stripe and online collaboration company Dropbox. Founded in 2005 by married couple Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston and two others in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Y Combinator moved to the Bay Area and became synonymous with the startup scene in Silicon Valley in the decade that followed. Its semiannual \u201cbatches,\u201d three-month programs in which companies work closely together and with YC partners, advisors and alumni before presenting to investors and journalists as part of a Demo Day, carry a typical 1.5% to 2% acceptance rate, according to its website. YC has funded more than 3,500 companies to date, and 80 unicorns valued at $1 billion or more.\n\nGeoff Ralston will leave Y Combinator after the transition to Tan as president is complete.\n\nUnder Graham\u2019s successor Sam Altman and then Ralston, Y Combinator underwent a period of rapid expansion that has both expanded its reach and its notoriety in the tech ecosystem. YC now expects to invest $500,000 in participating companies, in exchange for at least 7% equity and potentially much more, depending on a company\u2019s later funding rounds. In 2021, even as YC went fully remote in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, it funded 750 companies, a Y Combinator record. Ralston made headlines in December 2021, when he told the Newcomer blog he envisioned a path to funding 1,000 startups per batch.\n\nThis past summer, however, Y Combinator downsized its summer batch by 40%. Other YC initiatives, such as onetime plans to move the accelerator\u2019s headquarters from Mountain View, California, to San Francisco, have been quietly abandoned.\n\nIn separate interviews, Tan and Ralston take a line popular with current and former YC staff: that doubts about YC getting too big, or \u201cjumping the shark,\u201d are nearly as old as the accelerator itself. They both say they feel confident that the engineer-led ethos of the organization will always drive it to experiment unabashedly on behalf of its entrepreneurs. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether there\u2019ll be batches of 1,000 in the near term, but I believe that potential exists out there,\u201d Ralston says. \u201cWe\u2019re a big world.\u201d\n\nOnce Tan has fully taken over leadership duties, Ralston plans to move on from Y Combinator, he says; there are no plans for him to remain as chairman as Altman had initially been expected to do. Ralston hopes his three-year-plus legacy at the accelerator to be remembered as one of stability, a time when the program\u2019s long-term future solidified into something more akin to an academic institution like Stanford University. \u201cI made changes in the direction that Sam was going, and I suspect that it will be [that way] with Garry as well,\u201d he says.\n\nIn his absence, Tan\u2019s VC firm, Initialized, will be led by managing partners Jen Wolf and Brett Gibson moving forward. Both are longtime collaborators of Tan\u2019s: Wolf was Tan\u2019s boss before he applied to Y Combinator early in his career; Gibson was Tan\u2019s cofounder in Posterous, the company with which he applied. In an interview, Wolf says she was already managing day-to-day operations at Initialized for the past year as its president. The firm will continue under the same branding and remaining partnership, she adds.\n\n\u201cGarry\u2019s not zero-sum in his views on the world, or managing people. Someone doesn\u2019t have to lose for someone else to win,\u201d says Wolf. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do this if he didn\u2019t think we were ready.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s a surprise move for Tan, who last year told Forbes in a profile that his early investment success gave him \u201ca golden ticket\u201d to build Initialized into a lasting institution in venture capital. (In an interview last week, Tan quoted the same 2021 article back to Forbes, noting that he\u2019d said then that he hoped to build a firm that would outlast its founders.)\n\nCapital is abundant, Tan argues; opportunity for entrepreneurs, less so. He invokes his own personal story, growing up, he says, in the East Bay food insecure and learning to code to make Web pages to help his parents make a down payment on a house.\n\n\u201cYC is a beacon where you don\u2019t have to know anyone,\u201d Tan says. \u201cPeople gave me so much, taught me so much, and I need to give back.\u201d"}

Called \u201cCampaign UW: Creating Futures,\u201d it was the most successful private fundraiser in the school\u2019s history.\n\nPerhaps this is what most Washingtonians will remember about Emmert. But for us, we will remember his commitment to diversity. Diversity is a word often thrown around casually. Everyone says, \u201cOh, of course diversity is a priority for me.\u201d But as publisher Assunta Ng illustrated in her blog, past UW presidents did not always follow their words with actions like Emmert has.\n\nDuring Emmert\u2019s tenure, 11 honorary degrees were conferred by the UW Board of Regents, five of which were given to people of color. These include Ban Ki-Moon, Quincy Jones, the Dalai Lama, Virginia Beavert, and of course, the Japanese American students of 1941 and 1942.\n\nIn 1942, 449 Japanese Americans were forced to leave the UW following an executive order that led to their internment. Though Congress passed a resolution in 1988, apologizing for and redressing the injustices of the order, it took another 20 years before the interned Japanese Americans would receive their degrees. In May 2008, the former students were given honorary Bachelor of Arts degrees from the university in a ceremony called The Long Journey Home.\n\n\u201cThe most noticeable [trait of Emmert] is his commitment to diversity \u2014 to open, meaningfully, the university to all students, staff, faculty, and administrators based on their individual merit and talent,\u201d said Tetsudan Kashima, UW professor and chair of the The Long Journey Home Committee. \u201cA striking example of this was his enthusiastic reaction to a 2008 proposal to confer UW honorary baccalaureate degrees to 449 Nisei students who were summarily removed from the UW in 1942 on government orders. Asking \u2018Why wasn\u2019t this done earlier?\u2019 President Emmert and the UW, in a moving ceremony \u2026 helped to rectify a past social injustice. The fact that it took decades before the university took this action is not the point. The real lesson is that once it was brought to President Emmert\u2019s attention, he saw the issue and helped to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, of 23 appointments to dean, chancellor, or vice president positions during Emmert\u2019s tenure, there were 11 males appointed and 12 females appointed.\n\nProvost Phyllis Wise will be interim president in Emmert\u2019s place. Replacing her will be interim Provost Mary Lidstrom, the vice provost for research. It will be the first time the UW has had two females in these positions.\n\nWe have no doubt that Emmert will take this enthusiasm for different viewpoints to the NCAA, and we are excited to see how he will shape such an influential organization for the better.\n\n\u201cWe simply must make sure that our athletics programs represent all of the United States and all of our complexity,\u201d Emmert said at the NCAA Champion and Expert Coaches Forums. \u201cWe have to be committed in higher education and intercollegiate athletics to the philosophy of promoting diversity in our work. We have much work to do, and I\u2019m going to help you take that on.\u201d \u2666"}

In addition to his two terms as governor, he has brought decades of experience spearheading transformations at high-profile institutions in the private and public sectors.\n\nBaker has arrived at the NCAA at a moment of significant transformation. Legal shifts in the environment surrounding college sports have challenged the NCAA's ability to serve as an effective national regulator for college athletics, resulting in an untenable patchwork of individual state laws. Partnering with federal policymakers to develop a consistent, sustainable legal framework to address issues common to student-athletes and athletic departments across the country is a top and immediate priority.\n\nA Republican governor serving a predominantly Democratic state, Baker was re-elected to a second term in 2018 with 67 percent of the vote. After eight years in office, he achieved approval ratings exceeding 75 percent, making him the highest-rated governor in the United States and one of the highest-rated elected representatives in the nation. Baker earned widespread support by taking on issues with significant real-world impacts, and approaching them in substantive, innovative and bipartisan ways. Among his accomplishments during his two terms in office, Baker unleashed unprecedented investment into Massachusetts' K-12 education system, eliminated the state's structural budget deficit while cutting taxes, and led the nation in securing renewable energy sources to respond to climate change. As governor, Baker oversaw a 43,000-member workforce and was responsible for a $50 billion annual budget.\n\nPrior to his tenure as governor, Baker had a distinguished career in business, nonprofit and government administration. Immediately prior to being elected governor, he served as executive in residence at General Catalyst Partners, where he served as an advisor to a variety of companies working on \"Responsible Innovations\". In particular, he co-led the development and launch of Oscar Health, now a personalized health insurance company operating in several states with a $6 billion valuation.\n\nEarlier in his career, Baker served as CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a nonprofit health benefits provider. Under Baker's leadership, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care went from the verge of bankruptcy to 24 consecutive profitable quarters and a reputation as one of America's top health care plans. Prior to this, Baker served in a variety of leadership roles in Massachusetts state government, including as secretary of administration and finance, and as secretary of health and human services. In that role, he led the state's efforts to turn a billion-dollar budget deficit into a surplus and reform the K-12 education system which today leads the nation in student performance. Early in his career, Baker ran a state policy think tank focused on innovations for improving health care.\n\nBaker is a graduate of Harvard, where he was a member of the men's varsity basketball team, and holds a Master's of Business Administration from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He is married to Lauren Baker, a former collegiate gymnast at Northwestern University, and father to three children (two of whom are former college athletes): Charlie, AJ, and Caroline."}

Both efforts failed.\n\nPrior to joining the Senate, Woo was a senior fellow in public policy at the Asian Institute of Research at the University of British Columbia, and is the former president of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.\n\nHe has long been a supporter of closer trade ties between Canada and China.\n\nBut his opposition to a motion that would have condemned China for its incursions in the South China Sea prompted some Conservatives to brand him an apologist for the authoritarian regime. Woo strenuously denied those accusations in an interview with CBC News last week.\n\nVoted with government 100% of the time\n\nIn addition to his vocal support for the budget, Woo has been friendly to government legislation on the whole. Woo voted with the government's representative in the Senate, Peter Harder, 100 per cent of the time during the last sitting, according to an analysis compiled by CBC News.\n\nSaint-Germain, appointed alongside Woo to the Senate last November, is a former senior public servant and ombudsperson for Quebec. She voted with Harder 95.8 per cent of the time.\n\nThe ISG \u2014 composed of recently named Trudeau appointees and others who left the Liberal and Conservative caucuses \u2014 is poised to become the largest bloc of senators this fall, when it leapfrogs over the opposition Conservatives.\n\nThe current make up of the Senate is 36 Conservatives, 35 members of the ISG, 16 Liberals and eight non-affiliated members who sit outside of all Senate groups. After a series of retirements and high-profile resignations,10 new senators will be named this fall.\n\nDespite being appointed by a Liberal prime minister, those new senators are expected to join the ranks of the ISG. Trudeau booted Liberals from the national Liberal caucus at the height of the Senate expenses scandal in 2014.\n\nWoo has said, as leader, he will fight for space on Senate committees for Independent senators. He will also push for more money to help staff the ISG secretariat, a group of staff that support the work of Independent senators."}

His announcement of a move to a more independent and less partisan Senate had many political observers scratching their heads because such appointments had previously been, at least in part, an opportunity to appoint party loyalists. At the same time, it infuriated some veteran Liberal senators, who would no longer be welcome in the PM\u2019s parliamentary caucus.\n\nAt that time, few would have predicted the course of this initiative and how, or even if, it would get off the ground. The outcome was unpredictable because independent senators truly outside the boundaries of direct political control were likely to chart their own course \u2013 both individually and collectively. This is precisely what has happened and even more changes are afoot.\n\nThis is a good moment to look at how Senate reform is unfolding. The mandate of the Liberal government has been recently extended and we have a new parliamentary session, which we expect will bring a substantial legislative agenda. With a growing cohort of independent senators, it will be interesting to see how the Senate deals with some of the important issues of the day amid the pandemic and its many disruptions.\n\nIn 2015, there were a handful of senators sitting as independents. As we enter 2022, fully 80 per cent of senators are independent, having no affiliation with a political caucus in Parliament. There are currently 85 senators in four organized groups: The Independent Senators Group (ISG) has 42 members; the Progressive Senate Group (PSG) and the Canadian Senators Group (CSG) have 14 and 13 members respectively, and the Conservatives have 16 members. Other than the Speaker of the Senate and the three members of the Government Representative\u2019s Office, two senators are not affiliated with any group, bringing the total number of senators to 91, with 14 vacancies awaiting new appointments. Notably, the Conservatives are the only group with formal ties to a House of Commons political caucus.\n\nThis shift away from a duopoly in the Senate is reflected in amendments to the Parliament of Canada Act, which is now before the House of Commons.\n\nFormer Conservative Senator Scott Tannas now leads the CSG, while the PSG is led by former Liberal Senator Jane Cordy. The ISG was formed with the first wave of independent appointments early in 2016. It had been led for the past four years by Yuen Pau Woo, an economist and former chair of the Asia-Pacific Foundation. Effective Jan. 1, Senator Raymonde Saint-Germain, a former deputy minister and ombudsperson in Quebec, assumed the leadership of the group, which has consistently focused on Senate reform.\n\nSeveral waves of independent appointments by Trudeau have occurred since 2015, following recommendations from an independent appointment panel. The first in early 2016 included Murray Sinclair, Frances Lankin, Ratna Omidvar, Raymonde Gagn\u00e9 and Chantal Petitclerc. It became a magnet for further applicants and a signal that independence was being taken seriously. That trend has continued. The most recent appointments in the second half of 2021 included two former mayors, Karen Sorensen and Bernadette Clement; as well as Indigenous leader Mich\u00e8le Audette; entrepreneur and business leader Amina Gerba; economist and former bank executive Cl\u00e9ment Gignac; former president of the Saint John Port Authority, Jim Quinn; and the former president of the Canadian Labour Congress, Hassan Yussuff.\n\nIndependent senators appointed since 2016 have added to the considerable talent of those who preceded them. Canada\u2019s senators have decades of experience in myriad fields, including medicine, law, human rights, science, social and economic policy, foreign policy, the arts, sports, business, banking, financial and energy regulation, the environment, and labour and employment policy.\n\nAs a result of Trudeau\u2019s appointments, the Senate reached gender parity briefly in 2020 \u2013 it now stands at 45 women and 46 men. Indigenous senators make up 10 per cent of the Senate. Several senators recently launched the African Canadian Senate Group, a coalition of senators from the different groups, committed to fighting discrimination while giving African Canadians a voice in the Senate.\n\nThe presence of multiple groups \u2014 all having some degree of interest in seeing the institution work more effectively \u2014 has in many cases led to more dynamic and multi-faceted debates and less political posturing than under the us-versus-them dynamic of the former government/opposition duopoly. The debate last year on C-7, the medical assistance in dying bill, is a prime example of thoughtful and less partisan debate that led to significant changes in the bill, including the removal of the mental-health exclusion clause.\n\nSome recent initiatives are beginning to pave the way for a more positive working environment for staff and better oversight and transparency in the Senate. Senators from all groups worked together to comprehensively address harassment in the workplace and online with a new and more rigorous workplace harassment policy, which has been well received by Senate staff. A new audit and oversight committee, which includes independent members who are not Senators, is now in place to identify potential financial and related risks, and to advise on how they can be addressed.\n\nGoing forward. there is also considerable interest in forming a business planning committee to bring a more systematic and predictable approach to scheduling debates. There is growing consensus that planning Senate business and scheduling debates on bills would ensure that bills receive an appropriate amount of scrutiny, preventing fast-track, \u201cblank cheque\u201d approvals on the one hand, as well as avoiding counterproductive, endless delays on the other.\n\nFinally, there has been recent agreement on having key government ministers attending the Senate\u2019s question period on a more regular basis, allowing senators to ask questions about initiatives and issues in a minister\u2019s portfolio and to raise questions about government policies.\n\nOn the same note, the Senate Conservatives, led by Senator Don Plett, are now a smaller caucus but punch above their weight and maintain a robust role as the Official Opposition in holding the government to account.\n\nSince 2015, the Senate has more frequently amended government bills, with many changes proposed by independent senators being endorsed by the government. From 2015-19, one-third of government bills were amended in the Senate. In each case the House of Commons accepted some, if not all, of the Senate\u2019s amendments. In comparison, under the previous process for appointing senators, only one of 61 government bills was successfully amended by the Senate between 2013-15.\n\nWhile the pace of reform often seems slow, the changes described here are the most significant in the history of the 154-year-old institution. Above all, the longstanding duopoly has faded, allowing senators to provide more robust sober second thought on government bills as well as on important public policies. This means that government bills receive a fresh and critical look in the Senate. as opposed to a replay of earlier debates in the House of Commons. It also means that senators have more freedom to advocate and legislate on behalf of their provinces and territories, as well as for minorities and vulnerable Canadians, which remains an important part of their responsibilities.\n\nMost important of all is that these changes are to the benefit of Canadians, who are paying for all of this and who deserve more value from their parliamentary institutions."}

Isbell will begin in his new role on August 1, succeeding Karl Scholz, who is departing to assume the presidency of the University of Oregon. Letters & Science Dean Eric Wilcots is serving as interim provost.\n\n\u201cThroughout my academic career I have been focused on research and educational reform,\u201d says Isbell, who describes himself as a computationalist. \u201cI am a strong believer that higher education must play a vital role in creating opportunities for deep engagement in what it means to be an active and productive member of society.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to be joining UW\u2013Madison, a place I\u2019ve long admired for its dynamic and world-leading teaching, learning and research, and I look forward to becoming a part of the Madison community.\u201d\n\nIsbell comes to UW\u2013Madison from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he has been the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of the College of Computing since 2019. The college has nearly 20,000 students and its undergraduate and graduate computer science programs recently ranked 5th and 8th, respectively.\n\nUnder his leadership, the college has been widely viewed as one of the most innovative computing programs in the country. Known as a collaborative leader, Isbell has also held prior leadership roles at Georgia Tech, including serving as executive associate dean for two years before his deanship.\n\nOriginally from Chattanooga, Tenn., Isbell received a Bachelor of Science degree from Georgia Tech and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n\nFollowing his education, he joined AT&T Labs/Research before returning to Georgia Tech in 2002 to join the faculty of the College of Computing. The unifying theme of his research is machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly using technology to build systems to foster lifelong learning.\n\nIsbell is internationally recognized in his field. In 2021, he was elected to the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has won two \u201cbest paper\u201d awards for technical contributions in artificial intelligence and machine learning, was named a National Academy of Sciences Kavli Fellow in addition to NSF Faculty Early Career Development Program and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency awards for young investigators.

Schaffner will oversee the museum\u2019s permanent collection, exhibitions, residency program, publications, and scholarship. She began her new role in February 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to have Ingrid Schaffner join Chinati in this newly established and vitally important role,\u201d says Director Jenny Moore. \u201cIt is an exciting time for Chinati. The Museum of Modern Art retrospective brings new perspectives to Donald Judd\u2019s art. Chinati is a place to explore the fullness of Judd\u2019s vision as an artist interested in architecture and design, as a preservationist and an iconoclast. Ingrid is an outstanding curator, highly esteemed in the field for making an incredible range of exhibitions, from expansive surveys to revelatory solo shows. We look forward to having Ingrid\u2019s talent and expertise shape this next phase of Chinati\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Judd\u2019s concept for the Chinati Foundation was curatorial: to permanently site works of art within a dynamic of exhibitions, scholarship, artists residencies, and events,\u201d says Schaffner. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to join Jenny Moore and work with the Chinati team and board of trustees to amplify the capacity of the curatorial to keep us looking and thinking about art, architecture, and the land in Marfa. It is an honor to build on the curatorial legacy established by Judd, work that continued with director emerita Marianne Stockebrand and Rob Weiner, through to the spirit at Chinati today.\u201d\n\nDonald Judd established the Chinati Foundation in 1986 as a museum made by and for artists. Judd\u2019s concept of a new situation for art, where work would be permanently installed on a large scale according to the wishes of the artists themselves, within the context of the distinct light and land of far West Texas, sets Chinati apart as a unique and pioneering institution. Schaffner comes to Chinati with a distinguished history of working closely with artists on the installation and exhibition of their work, including opportunities for artists to act as curators themselves. She is recently the curator of the 57th Carnegie International, America\u2019s most historic survey of contemporary art.\n\nSchaffner joins Chinati at a significant moment. In 2017 the museum completed its first master plan and has launched a comprehensive campaign to fund the priorities it identifies, including buildings and land restoration, meeting the needs of a growing number of visitors, and building Chinati\u2019s endowment. Given the scope of these initiatives, Chinati\u2019s leadership deemed it critically important that a new position be created focused specifically on the museum\u2019s artistic program. Says Moore: \u201cThe curatorial position strengthens Chinati\u2019s mission to preserve and present Judd\u2019s vision for many years to come.\u201d\n\nAbout Ingrid Schaffner\n\nIngrid Schaffner is an American curator and writer, whose work coalesces around themes of archiving and collecting, photography, feminism, and alternate modernisms. As curator of the 2018 Carnegie International, at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Schaffner presented major installations by artists and collectives, including El Anatsui, Alex Da Corte, Zoe Leonard, Postcommodity, and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, along with \u201cDig Where You Stand,\u201d a new look at the museum\u2019s permanent collections by Koyo Kouoh, all within an overarching ethos of \u201cMuseum Joy.\u201d\n\nFrom 2000 through 2015, Schaffner directed the exhibition program as chief curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) at the University of Pennsylvania, where she increased the rigor, diversity, and popular appeal of its program. She facilitated artists as curators, with exhibitions by Kara Walker, Virgil Marti, and Christian Marclay and brought attention to under-recognized artists, little-explored themes, and emerging practices within contemporary art. Her ICA exhibitions include: Barry LeVa, Accumulated Vision; Dirt on Delight: Impulses That Form Clay; Anne Tyng: Inhabiting Geometry; Queer Voice; and Jason Rhoades, Four Roads.\n\nSchaffner\u2019s work has been recognized with awards from the International Art Critics Association (AICA) and grants from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. Schaffner attended the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s Independent Study Program and holds a master\u2019s degree in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.\n\nHer belief that writing about art should be lively and engaging as well as acutely researched informs her many publications, including: Deep Storage: Collecting, Storing, and Archiving in Art (Prestel) and Julien Levy: Portrait of an Art Gallery (MIT Press). She is co-authoring a history of Skowhegan, the summer art program in Maine, founded by artists for artists in 1946.\n\nAbout the Artistic Program at the Chinati Foundation\n\nThe Chinati Foundation opened to the public in 1987. Among the earliest works installed were Donald Judd\u2019s 15 outdoor works in concrete and 100 works in mill aluminum in two converted artillery sheds. The collection and museum have grown to include works of art by thirteen artists sited across thirty-four buildings on 340 acres. Stewarding the permanent collection is at the core of every aspect of Chinati\u2019s artistic program and mission. As curator, Schaffner will work closely with the Chinati team and leadership to develop possibilities to expand the permanent collection, and actively build upon the diverse special exhibitions program, begun by Judd in 1987. Over the years, exhibitions at Chinati have encompassed Guatemalan toys and textiles, drawings by Mondrian and prints by D\u00fcrer, polyurethane foam sculptures by John Chamberlain, as well as a camera obscura by Zoe Leonard, Charlotte Posenenske\u2019s modular cardboard unlimited editions, and a site-specific wall painting by Bridget Riley.\n\nThe annual Chinati Weekend, held every October since 1987, is the occasion of exhibition openings, lectures, and performances. Periodic symposia dedicated to aspects of the museum\u2019s permanent collection have included: Art in the Landscape (1985), Art and Architecture (1998), It\u2019s All in the Fit: The Work of John Chamberlain (2006), Donald Judd\u2019s Writings (2008), and the Chinati Foundation Master Plan (2017), along with related publications. The Chinati Foundation Newsletter is a scholarly journal, published annually.\n\nOther facets of Chinati\u2019s artistic program that Schaffner will oversee include the artist in residence program, also started by Judd, which brings approximately six emerging or established artists to work in Marfa for a period of two to three months, and public programs such as lectures, concerts, and dance and theatrical performances."}

Leshin, previously the dean of the School of Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), will be the first woman to lead WPI in the university's 150-year history.\n\nBoth of Leshin's Caltech degrees were in geochemistry. \"Laurie did an important thesis measuring the deuterium/hydrogen ratios of martian meteorites that got her off to a strong start in her academic career. Her subsequent contributions as a professor, as a scientist and administrator at NASA, and as an academic leader at RPI have prepared her well for this leadership role,\" says Caltech interim president and William E. Leonhard Professor of Geology Edward Stolper, who, along with Sam Epstein (Caltech's first Leonhard Professor), coadvised Leshin during her time as a graduate student at Caltech.\n\nAfter earning her doctoral degree from Caltech in 1995, Leshin worked as a postdoctoral fellow at UCLA, followed by a faculty position as a professor of geological sciences at Arizona State University (ASU). Her research and administrative contributions led to her appointment, in 2005, as director of science exploration at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Leshin joined the faculty at RPI in 2011.\n\nIn her administrative position at RPI, she increased the size of the institute faculty while also supporting curriculum changes and interdisciplinary academic initiatives. She also continued her research as a geochemist and space scientist, and served as a member of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Science Team that analyzed data collected by the Curiosity rover to find the evidence of water on the surface of Mars.\n\n\"She is a natural leader,\" says Curiosity project scientist John Grotzinger, Caltech's Fletcher Jones Professor of Geology. \"Laurie Leshin is a first-rate scholar with tremendous energy and a deep understanding of planetary science. Her involvement in MSL has been substantial even as she worked as dean at RPI, engaging as a member of two different instrument teams and also serving as a mission strategic planner, helping to integrate Curiosity's complex activities.\"\n\nWhen Leshin begins her term as WPI's 16th president on July 1, 2014, she will join a list of at least 11 other Caltech alumni who are currently serving as presidents of colleges, universities, and research institutions around the world."}

Formerly the Ellice Islands, it was administered together with the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati) until 1975. Tuvalu, which means \u201ceight islands together\u201d, became an independent constitutional monarchy on 1 October 1978, with Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State. In 1986 Tuvalu approved a new, locally written, Constitution. Tuvalu is ranked as the fourth smallest country in the world in terms of geography.\n\n\n\nThe country is very concerned about climate change. The highest point of elevated land in Tuvalu is between four and five metres, which provides the basis to their concerns - particularly with respect to the threat of sea level rises. The fragility of the island group was underscored in 1997 when tropical cyclones Gavin and Hina and the very recent cyclone Pam caused a lot of damage to the islands.\n\n\n\nTuvalu became a member of the ILO in March 2008 and to date has ratified the Maritime Labour Convention or MLC which came into force in August 2013. The ILO office for Pacific Island countries continues to work closely with the tripartite constituents. The tripartite setting in Tuvalu is represented by the Government through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Tourism, Environment and Labour; the representative organisation of workers is the Tuvalu Seafarers Union and the representative organisation of employers is the Tuvalu National Private Sector Organization.\n\n\n\nThe ILO currently has two active projects in Tuvalu whereby technical assistance is provided in respect to labour law reform and labour migration initiatives.\n\n\n\nThe main areas of focus for the Labour Law reform work is to:\n\n\u2022 Provide technical assistance to the Government to review the Employment Act, Industrial Relations Code and Trade Unions Act, identify priorities for labour law reform, and develop new labour legislation to better comply with the ILO\u2019s eight Fundamental Labour Conventions.\n\n\u2022 Awareness raising for workers and employers on roles and responsibilities when new legislation is passed.\n\nThe Main area of focus for the Labour Migration project is to:\n\n\u2022 To improve labour migration data collection for the purpose of policymaking and increased participation of Tuvaluan workers in well-regulated labour migration schemes including seafaring and seasonal worker programs.\n\n\n\n"}

The Russian-Canadian executive had in effect run Chelsea on Abramovich\u2019s behalf in recent years and was responsible for looking after transfers and player contracts. She is close with the head coach, Thomas Tuchel, and has a reputation as a tough negotiator with agents and clubs.\n\nChelsea have said Granovskaia will continue to offer assistance until the end of this transfer window. But her departure will heap more responsibility on Boehly, with the co-owner set to operate as the interim sporting director until a replacement is found. \u201c\u2018We thank Marina for her many years of excellent service to the club and wish her all the best in her future ventures,\u201d Boehly said.\n\nThere has been a noticeable shift in Chelsea\u2019s approach to transfers. They have not dug their heels in after learning of Romelu Lukaku\u2019s desire to return to Internazionale. Boehly took charge of negotiations with Inter, who have agreed in principle to pay \u00a37m plus add-ons to sign Lukaku on loan, after deciding it would be counterproductive to deny the striker a move.\n\nLukaku, who is taking a large pay cut to join Inter, struggled badly after joining Chelsea for \u00a397.5m last summer. He struggled to fit into Thomas Tuchel\u2019s system and has openly pined for a return to Inter. Tuchel backed the departure and Boehly, a co-owner of the LA Dodgers, is keen to back the German.\n\nThere was a desire to sort out the Lukaku situation as swiftly as possible. It has not turned into a saga and the challenge now will be for Chelsea to strengthen their attack, with Manchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling a prominent target, and move quickly in the transfer market. It will be interesting to see how much influence Petr Cech, the technical and performance adviser, has this summer. The former Chelsea goalkeeper worked closely with Granovskaia, and insiders have praised his intelligence and diligence.\n\nView image in fullscreen Marina Granovskaia with Petr Cech before Chelsea\u2019s FA Cup semi-final win over Crystal Palace in April. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe hope will be that Chelsea, who intend to give Tuchel significant funds for signings, can act decisively after announcing their new board. Buck, a polarising figure in recent years, has agreed to step down at the end of this month. The American was appointed chairman after Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003.\n\n\u201cAs custodians of Chelsea FC, we now begin executing our long-term vision and plan for the club, creating an outstanding experience for its passionate, loyal fans, and continuing to challenge for top honours in line with Chelsea FC\u2019s decorated history,\u201d Boehly said. \u201cWorking together, side-by-side, we are firmly committed to winning, both on and off the pitch. For us, that effort has begun.\u201d\n\nThe new board includes Behdad Eghbali and Jos\u00e9 E Feliciano, co-controlling owners of Chelsea and founding partners of Clearlake; Mark Walter, the CEO and co-founder of Guggenheim Partners; Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire; Jonathan Goldstein, co-founder and CEO of Cain International; Barbara Charone, a celebrity publicist; Daniel Finkelstein, a Tory peer and Times columnist; and James Pade, a partner and managing director at Clearlake Capital.\n\nQuick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

Sembroski, Isaacman and two crewmates are due to ride into orbit later this year in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nAlthough Sembroski bought tickets for the raffle, he didn\u2019t actually win it: Instead, a friend from his college days at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University was chosen, according to The New York Times. The friend, who is remaining anonymous, decided not to go to space \u2014 and donated the ticket to Sembroski, a dedicated space fan.\n\nSembroski said he was stunned to learn he\u2019d be taking his friend\u2019s place. \u201cIt was this moment of, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to space? You picked me? Wow. Cool.\u2019 I mean, it was a moment of shock,\u201d he said today during a news briefing at SpaceX\u2019s Florida facility.\n\nThe 41-year-old Air Force veteran and former Space Camp counselor will serve as mission specialist and help manage payload operations, science experiments and mission communications.\n\nSembroski been living and working in the Seattle area for more than a decade, at ATS Automation, MacDonald-Miller Facility Solutions and most recently as machine fault detection and diagnostics lead at Lockheed Martin in Everett. He told GeekWire that he aims to keep up with his day job and his parenting duties at home as well as his spaceflight training.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a balancing act,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cI do have a great team. I am fortunate enough to have an awesome supervisor and company that I\u2019m working for, that has flexible time and schedules \u2014 and they understand that people have lives outside of work. I just can\u2019t think of any greater opportunity to take that extra time than to be part of this crew.\u201d\n\nSembroski said he\u2019s tried to use his Space Camp experience to inspire others to pursue their passions, with space exploration as the focus. \u201cNow, it\u2019s an incredible opportunity I have to take that message to a wider audience,\u201d he said.\n\nThe other crew member added to the mission today is Sian Proctor, a 51-year-old geoscience professor and STEM advocate at South Mountain Community College in Phoenix. Proctor was the winner of a separate \u201cShark Tank\u201d-style competition designed to reward innovative use of the Shift4Shop online commerce platform. Proctor used the software to power her space-art venture, and won out over about 200 other contestants.\n\n\u201cThis opportunity is proof that hard work and perseverance can pay off in unimaginable ways,\u201d Proctor, who\u2019s a licensed airplane pilot and has applied multiple times to become a NASA astronaut, said in a news release. \u201cI have always believed that I was preparing for something special, and that moment has arrived with Inspiration4.\u201d\n\nAt today\u2019s briefing, Proctor noted that her father worked at the NASA tracking station on Guam during the Apollo moon missions. \u201cI like to think that space has been in my DNA,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019ll be the mission pilot, backing up Isaacman in his role as mission commander.\n\nIsaacman, who\u2019s a trained jet pilot and will be at the Crew Dragon\u2019s controls, selected the fourth member of the crew last month.

The increasing pressure from the authorities is part of a campaign to eliminate traces of Western involvement in Russian life.\n\nThirty years after opening an office in Moscow, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) appears to be on its way out. The group has become a victim of both punishing legislation designed to constrain and demonise foreign media and journalists, as well as related fines that now stand at 2.3 million US dollars.\n\nWhile RFE/RL President Jamie Fly has condemned Russia\u2019s attempts to force the broadcaster and the Current Time video-producing network to leave the country and vowed to \u201ccontinue to fight these attacks\u2026 through all possible means\u201d, downsizing has already begun at the media outlets. Both operations will \u201csignificantly limit\u201d their presence in Russia and have offered some employees a choice of relocating to the Czech Republic or Ukraine. With deadlines looming over the payment of the fines, and the continued enforcement of Russian legislation, what will happen next is uncertain.\n\n\u201cI am surprised that it was allowed to function this long when other foreign organisations were closed down already in 2015-2016\u201d, said Mark G. Pomar, the former executive director of the Board for International Broadcasting. This American agency oversaw RFE/RL until the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) was created in 2018. USAGM is the federal agency that oversees RFE/RL, Voice of America, Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network.\n\nThe former director added that Russia is trying to shut out the world, stating that that they have been \u201cdoing that for the past five years and they hadn\u2019t got around to RFE/RL until now\u201d. He also stated that \u201cLogically speaking it fits perfectly with what [President Vladimir] Putin wants to do, which is to eliminate any and all traces of Western involvement in Russian life\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s present is in the past\n\nRussia \u201chas always been authoritarian in its own historical way\u201d and is now simply \u201casserting its political traditions\u201d, explained Pomar, now a senior fellow at the Clements Center for National Security at the University of Texas.\n\nArguably, RFE/RL\u2019s departure from Russia could have been predicted as early as 2002. This year saw Putin revoke President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s 1991 decree that allowed the American broadcaster to open a \u201cpermanent\u201d office in Russia, \u201cbecause of its role in the objective coverage of the march of the democratic processes\u201d.\n\nPutin has reversed these processes, thereby making RFE/RL not only irrelevant but now an outright threat to his regime. The Russian government has pushed through five dangerous statutes over the last decade that are meant to restrict and ultimately banish foreign media from the country.\n\nThe first of these is the 2012 \u201cforeign agent\u201d statute, which was recently amended in 2020. This law demands that foreign media must label every text, video, audio and social media release as \u201cfulfilling the function of a foreign agent\u201d. This suggests to Russians that everything foreign should not be trusted and is harmful to the country.\n\nThe second is the catch-all 2012 \u201cDima Yakovlev Law\u201d, which was updated in 2015. It permits the Ministry of Justice to indefinitely suspend non-commercial organisations (NCOs) taking part in \u201ca political activity\u201d, as well as anything that is considered \u201ca threat to the interests\u201d of Russia and receives funds or property from American entities or citizens. The law also prohibits foreign NCOs from establishing mass media outlets. The provisions added in 2015 specify what \u201cundesirable activity\u201d may be banned when \u201cpublished by a foreign or international non-governmental organisation\u2026 as well [its] production or storage\u201d.\n\nThe 2013 Federal Statue on Information, which was amended in 2017 and again in 2019, is third in the Kremlin\u2019s line-up of weapons designed to restrict foreign media. It allows Russian authorities to apply fines and other measures against those distributing online information \u201cwith calls to mass disorder, to conduct extremist activity and to participate in mass (public) events held in violation of established procedure\u201d. Information from \u201cundesirable\u201d foreign organisations is now also illegal. The law also forbids the \u201cdissemination of knowingly inaccurate, socially significant information under the guise of reliable messages\u201d.\n\nTo ensure the Russian media\u2019s \u2018purity\u2019, the 2014 Media Statute and its 2017 revisions dramatically limit foreign investments in and ownership of Russian media.\n\nLastly, the 2018 Statute on Countermeasures is specifically meant to \u201ccounter\u201d the \u201cunfriendly\u201d actions taken by Washington and other nations against controversial Russian organisations such as Sputnik and RT.\n\nViolating its own constitution and international obligations and commitments\n\nThe Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation upheld the legality of the statutes. Despite this, Andrei Richter has noted that this decision was not unanimous. Richter is a media law expert, former professor at Moscow State University and advisor to the OCSE Representative on Freedom of the Media.\n\nAccording to one spokesperson from the US Department of State, the US is certain that Russia is violating its own constitution. Furthermore, by challenging freedom of expression, Moscow is disregarding \u201cthe country\u2019s international obligations and commitments\u201d.\n\nPredictably, RFE/RL\u2019s President Jamie Fly agrees and considers the regulations \u201ca state sponsored assault on media freedom that violates the Russian Constitution and Russia\u2019s media law\u201d.\n\nWhile there is now no Soviet style jamming of foreign broadcasting or Gosteleradio, the communist broadcasting censor, Russia is attempting to censor the Internet. Roskomnadzor, the state\u2019s enforcer of media-related legislation, recorded hundreds of occasions in which RFE/RL violated the \u201cforeign agent\u201d statute since the start of the year. The federal executive body subsequently imposed fines totaling 2.3 million dollars on the broadcaster. To date, Russian courts have rejected all appeals by the American media group.\n\nWhat can be done\n\n\u201cMy sense is that this has to be dealt with at the political level. If not at the presidential level than at the [US] Secretary of State one\u201d, concludes Pomar.\n\nThe US Department of State has not indicated what steps it might take in response to Russia\u2019s actions. However, a spokesperson has said that it \u201cis deeply concerned by Russia\u2019s increasingly repressive efforts to clamp down on the exercise of freedom of expression, including members of the press\u201d.\n\nThe representative went on to say that the expanded reach and employment of the \u201cforeign agents\u201d statute is a \u201cblatant effort to further excessively monitor, regulate, and restrict the activities and freedom of expression for members of Russia\u2019s civil society, independent media, political opposition, and other independent voices\u201d.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken conveyed his \u201cconcern over Russia\u2019s efforts to close Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and silence this valued source of independent reporting\u201d. It is not clear whether the new sanctions, which were imposed on Russia on April 15th for a number of \u201cmalign\u201d actions, also include the Kremlin\u2019s war against the American broadcaster.\n\nRFE/RL\u2019s imminent exit from Russia will affect its nearly seven million-strong audience and millions more who follow its Current Time network. It may also affect the group\u2019s Tatar-Bashkir and Ukrainian services. The related Crimea.Realities project, too, as well as Polygraph.info, a fact-checking website focused on Russia, may be affected.\n\nOn a positive note\u2026\n\nPomar does see an upside to RFE/RL\u2019s current troubles. He argues that \u201cWhen you have a bureau you are also tied down by that\u201d. The former director also stated that moving to another country can help you \u201cre-think the way you are going to have to do the program\u2026 there are a lot of things that you can do\u201d.\n\nAccording to Pomar, the RFE/RL president \u201cis facing a reality that every other Western organisation has faced [in Russia] and so the only thing that the US can do is learn lessons from the Cold War\u201d. RFE/RL could subsequently \u201ctake on subjects that the Russians are trying to control and open them up. So, take for example WWII. They have created this phenomenal myth about the war, which runs counter to the Polish experience, the Czech experience, the Baltics\u2019 experience, the Ukrainian or the American one\u201d.\n\nOf course, there are hundreds of topics to be addressed regarding this era. This includes the 1940 Katyn massacre of over 22,000 Polish officers and intellectuals, the new myth of Stalin, his repression, the gulags, and the dissidents that, according to Pomar, \u201cplenty of Russians don\u2019t know about\u201d. He has argued that these important subjects should be discussed alongside hundreds of others that Moscow \u201cwants to sanitise\u201d.\n\nAs always, the question of funding will be crucial to RFE/RL\u2019s ability to deal with the challenges of running a restricted service in Russia or from outside the country. Ted Lipien, a former RFE/RL president, says that the broadcaster needs additional funding specifically earmarked for its Russian service. This is in contrast to \u201callowing the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to make critical decisions about Radio Svoboda (Radio Liberty) and Current Time in Russia from the remote and over-bureaucratised bubble in Washington\u201d.\n\nDuring Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, then senator Joe Biden saved RFE/RL from being defunded by Congress in the name of a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d. Pomar now hopes that President Biden will involve himself in the broadcaster\u2019s struggle with the Kremlin and its attempts to remove the operation from Russia. If that fails, he believes that \u201ccertain steps can be taken to at least make it a bit painful for Russia to do this\u201d.\n\nWith the sanctions that have already been imposed, it is unclear how Washington can further punish Russia for its recent attacks on free media. Moscow\u2019s moves have included eliminating media freedoms, arresting and assassinating dissidents, cyber-hacking, waging information war, and interfering in elections. Despite the presence of an active opposition in the country, history has shown that Russia does not mind autocratic leadership and can take a whole lot of punishment.\n\nPeter Gross Ph.D., is professor emeritus and former Director of the University of Tennessee\u2019s School of Journalism and Electronic Media (2006-2016).

{"archive_url": "https://www.washingtonian.com/2023/02/03/metro-head-randy-clarke-talks-about-how-its-going-so-far/", "source_text": "Metro Head Randy Clarke Talks About How It\u2019s Going So Far\n\nBack in July, Metro celebrated Randy Clarke\u2019s first week as its general manager by literally lighting itself on fire: A cable near the Dupont Circle station failed, causing an electrical blaze that filled tunnels with smoke and knocked out service between Farragut North and Van Ness. It was only the latest reminder of how precarious the system has become, from the pandemic-related plunge in ridership to the October 2021 derailment that resulted in a diminished rail fleet that still hasn\u2019t fully recovered. Clarke\u2019s predecessor at WMATA, Paul Wiedefeld, had made an earlier-\u00adthan-planned exit after the revelation that Metro had let safety recertifications lapse for half of its rail operators.\n\nClarke, who previously ran Austin\u2019s transit system, has enjoyed something of a honeymoon period despite Metro\u2019s ongoing troubles. And he has already celebrated some successes, such as the completion of the Silver Line extension to Ashburn and the DC Council\u2019s bold plan to make bus service free inside the city. Clarke recently crafted a proposed budget that would eliminate Metro\u2019s $184 million budget gap and includes ideas such as simplifying the fare structure (no more peak fares!).\n\nThrough it all, Clarke has become a highly visible cheerleader for Metro, tweeting photos of his rides, responding to commuters\u2019 concerns, and in general trying to turn around the organization\u2019s culture. But really, people care much less about who\u2019s in charge than about getting where they\u2019re going in the smoothest possible way. \u201c \u2018How have you performed lately?\u2019 \u201d is Metro customers\u2019 real concern, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s fair to me.\u201d\n\nI was recently debating with somebody about whether you have the second- or third-most difficult job in Washington.\n\nWhat are the other one or two that you were debating?\n\nPresident of the United States is probably more difficult. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s harder to run Metro than to be, say, the House majority leader.\n\nOh, my God. I like how you leapfrogged the mayor and went right to House majority leader. Listen, I love this job and I\u2019m very privileged to have it. I think we\u2019ve got to be honest that it is a challenging role. But challenging jobs mean that what you do is really important to people\u2019s lives.\n\nSure, Metro touches everybody in this region in one way or another.\n\nEveryone\u2019s like, Oh, yeah, Metro: trains and buses and MetroAccess. That\u2019s the movement part. We\u2019re a massive employer. This budget proposal is over $4 billion. We have an enormous impact on economic development. Four percent of all the real estate in the DMV makes up basically about 30 percent of all the tax base, and that 4 percent of the property is within half a mile of a transit station. Where Metro goes is where the economic development grows.\n\nWe have national-security implications. Special events. We obviously get people to Nats games and concerts and Caps games and Wizards. Could you imagine the inauguration happening here without Metro? Could you imagine the Marine Corps [Marathon] or Fourth of July without Metro?\n\nI also can\u2019t imagine another organization that more people kvetch about.\n\nWe\u2019re held to probably the highest level of accountability of any governmental organization there is. Name another organization that gets the volume of tweets or complaints or discussion like Metro\u2014nothing, right?\n\nThat leads to my next question: You\u2019ve come here with the best of intentions. But some people before you in the role appeared very promising, then seemed to become overwhelmed by Metro\u2019s structural problems. Why should people expect this time to be different?\n\nThat\u2019s a fair question in one way, and probably not a fair question another way. What\u2019s fair about it is \u201cWho are you to come in here and be this person who solves all these problems?\u201d The unfair part of that is the suggestion that everyone was overwhelmed. You just said it\u2019s one of the hardest jobs in the region. You have a board, a public, changes in Richmond, changes in Annapolis, changes at city hall, changes to the federal government, externalities that you can\u2019t control. It\u2019s kind of hard to just say that the leader of this organization is solely responsible for success or failure. The public, rightfully, wants accountability. It\u2019s really hard to explain to the public that I don\u2019t control all of our funding. We can\u2019t control Covid policy, we can\u2019t control real-estate policy and zoning. That\u2019s a long way of getting at what I hope I\u2019ve demonstrated in my first four months: As long as I have the opportunity to do this job, I\u2019m going to give it every single ounce of my being.\n\nHow do you think about triaging Metro\u2019s issues that are long-term\u2014like funding\u2014as well as events you have to react to in the moment, like the December shootings at the Metro Center and Benning Road stations?\n\nI\u2019m not going to mince words: We have a societal gun-violence issue. And I think it\u2019s fair to say, and Covid exacerbated it, we have a lack of civility in our society. We\u2019ve increased police coverage. We\u2019ve got camera systems that we\u2019re working on enhancing. We\u2019ve hired mental-\u00adhealth crisis-intervention specialists to be out on the system. So we are all in on trying to ensure the safest system possible for both our customers and our staff. I mean, what kind of leader would you be if you didn\u2019t believe in that?\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by NBC4 Washington (@nbcwashington)\n\nThat is obviously different than how you solve the larger challenges in Metro. I think that was the premise of your question, which is, yeah, we have a significant funding challenge. This has been a 50-year conversation. I have a report on my desk from 1975 that said Metro\u2019s funding model needed to be fixed or it\u2019s going to be a complete disaster. That was the year before the Metrorail system opened!\n\nMetro cannot solve this on its own. We don\u2019t have our own taxing authority and money. Ridership and fare revenue do not move the needle significantly on changing where we need to be. We need to have a very honest and transparent conversation that says we can\u2019t afford to run the system we have today in fiscal year 2025.\n\nIt sounds like you boned up on Metro before you got here. What\u2019s surprised you about the system as you\u2019ve learned on the job?\n\nWe have a very committed and dedicated and passionate workforce. When you\u2019re in the fishbowl, it is very hard to find the right level of risk. It\u2019s very hard [when critics] say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you be more innovative [and] take risks on things like, say, technology?\u201d And just cultural-mindset stuff. Sometimes we\u2019ve created a little bit of lasagna here, for lack of a better term: Some report from, it could be 1998, said, You\u2019re bad at X. So instead of solving X, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m gonna build in 20 layers of lasagna to make sure that can never happen again. That\u2019s not a perfect analogy, so probably not the greatest quote. I want people to have a lot more imagination here at Metro, be a little more aspirational.\n\nAre you saying innovation is a difficult goal when everyone at Metro is on defense all the time?\n\nIf you worked here for the last year and a half, you got pounded every day. Every day, you\u2019re hearing that the organization is a disaster. I don\u2019t care how passionate you are about a topic or how committed you are, it impacts your wanting to go to work. If everyone said Washingtonian is the worst place possible, you wouldn\u2019t tell people you work there after a while, right? We want people to have pride in what they do.\n\nI\u2019ve leaned on transparency and being more proactive in my communication style. Just say what\u2019s going on and tell people what\u2019s wrong. They usually give you a lot of grace, because they\u2019re humans, too. There\u2019s a difference between making mistakes and being incompetent and malicious. There is not one person that would read this article that has never made a mistake. And if there is one out there, please tell them I\u2019m hiring. [Laughs.] In sincerity, we make mistakes all the time. What I\u2019m trying to tell people is if you put your hand up when you make a mistake, then we\u2019re going to learn from that and be a learning organization. Maybe I\u2019m a little naive, but I think the public in the last few months is appreciating Metro\u2019s willingness to be different that way.\n\nDo you get recognized when you\u2019re riding the system?\n\nYeah. I believe I am not only the chief customer advocate, the chief accountability officer, but I\u2019m also the chief transit promoter. I\u2019m out there a lot. Three, four, or five days a week, I get people coming up to me on a bus or train and wanting to say hi. The weirdest part is sometimes people want to take a picture.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case in Austin?\n\nNot like here. The good thing is I haven\u2019t gotten any reaction like someone yelling at me saying that we\u2019re horrible. There was a little bit of, like, Oh, man, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re on the train and bus. And that alone symbolizes something to me. I expect all of our team to be out on the system, being part of what we deliver.\n\nNo one\u2019s yelled at you, but has anyone given you a pretty good suggestion?\n\nOh, no question. I don\u2019t want to encourage just people to nonstop tweet me, but\u2014\n\nHaven\u2019t you kind of put yourself in that position by tweeting about your rides?\n\nTotally. And that\u2019s okay. As long as people will be understanding that I actually have a job, too, and just can\u2019t be on Twitter all day, right? I don\u2019t think anyone that\u2019s been on Twitter all day long has turned out to be successful at their job.\n\nSaturday date nights = transit nights, this time on our friends @DCCirculator who got us around safely on time. Enjoyed meeting Mr.Lee who is a retired @wmata \ud83d\ude8c operator now at Circulator. Hope you all are having a good weekend. #wmata pic.twitter.com/RtGDQ8I9Xc \u2014 Randy Clarke (@wmataGM) January 29, 2023\n\nYou\u2019re talking to a journalist, Randy.\n\nYeah, but if you only did Twitter, you couldn\u2019t write, right?\n\nUhh . . . .\n\n[Laughs.] I tried to create more of an avenue where people feel they can bring up what some here might feel was a small issue but could be actually a big issue to a customer. How it interacts with their life at 8:30 at night might seem small to us from an overall operational thing, but it\u2019s big in how it impacts their evening. These little things we\u2019ve been getting after pretty hard. That could be signage that\u2019s not good at a bus stop, or lighting or an escalator or some public-safety stuff. When I\u2019m in the system, there isn\u2019t a day that I don\u2019t send multiple texts with pictures for my team to work on. And they welcome it. Now a whole bunch of [Metro employees] are taking pictures.\n\nYou talked about funding as a huge issue. If you came across a magic lantern on the platform one morning and could get one wish by giving it a rub, what would you fix?\n\nI assume you mean this professionally? Not personally, right?\n\nI mean, it\u2019s your wish.\n\nIf I won Powerball for, like $1.8 billion and then I just gave a billion to Metro, that would be pretty good, right?\n\nThey\u2019d probably put up a statue of you at L\u2019Enfant Plaza.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about more money. I believe sources of funding are a structural issue. Every couple of years, having to go to Annapolis and Richmond and [the Wilson Building] and to the federal government is still going to be a structural challenge for the organization. We do need more funding for the services that the region wants. [But stable, consistent funding is what] creates the space for Metro to have a long duration to be strategic, to really lay out with our partners in the community what the game plan is for the next generation. Everyone wants this place to be more strategic and really be thinking big. And how do you do that if you don\u2019t have sustainable funding?\n\nHow will you know if what you\u2019re doing at Metro is working?\n\nI\u2019m feeling really good about where we are at the end of the year versus halfway through the year. Customer satisfaction has actually gone up significantly. Back in July, our customer satisfaction on rail was 66 percent. And at the close of November, it was 79 percent. Customer satisfaction does not move by 13 points in a few months if we\u2019re not making a difference.\n\nThis article appears in the February 2023 issue of Washingtonian.\n\nJoin the conversation!"}

She was Google's 16th employee, and the first to get pregnant. Now YouTube CEO and pregnant with her fifth child, Wojcicki talks to Maria Shriver on TODAY. Today\n\nWojcicki, 46, who is eight months pregnant, believes being a working mom benefits both her and her family.\n\n\u201cYour kids get something from your career and your career will get something from your kids,\u201d she said in an exclusive interview with NBC\u2019s Maria Shriver at YouTube's headquarters outside San Francisco.\n\nIt's been quite a journey to the top that began 16 years ago when Wojcicki and her husband rented their garage to two young computer scientists: Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who went on to found Google. Wojcicki became their 16th employee and the first one to get pregnant. She became the CEO of YouTube in February.\n\nWojcicki, pictured here with two of her four children, says that her career makes her a better mom and her family life makes her better at her work. Today\n\nHere are seven things to know about this pioneering woman in tech:\n\n1. She\u2019s home every night for dinner\n\nCrazy hours are the norm for many CEOs, especially in Silicon Valley, but Wojcicki tries to go home at 6 p.m. every night to be a part of the family meal.\n\n\u201cI try, because I found that if I'm home for dinner, I can get the scoop from my kids on the day. After my kids go to bed, I check email. It's about having that balance,\u201d she told Shriver on TODAY.\n\n2. She believes being a mom makes her better at her job\n\nNeeding to be home actually helps Wojcicki to be a more effective CEO because it forces her to prioritize and focus on things that have the biggest impact on her company, she noted.\n\n\u201cI want people to realize that it really is OK, that you can have a family. I don't feel like I'm a perfect mom, and then there are times at work where I feel like maybe I wasn't perfect here because of constraints on my time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut having the sum of both of those things going on in my life makes me a better mom at the end of the day, and I think gives me really important perspectives in the workplace as well.\u201d\n\nWhen you've got four -- soon to be five -- children, you know how to multitask and prioritize. Wojcicki says being a mom has helped her succeed at work, even though some people at times expected her to quit. Today\n\n3. Her company offers 18 weeks paid maternity leave, but she\u2019s not sure how long she will take with baby No. 5\n\n\u201cLots of people are asking me how long I'm going take off, and I don't want to give a specific date because I think well, what happens if I get to that date and then I feel like I need an extra week or I need an extra two weeks?\u201d Wojcicki said.\n\n4. Her advice to young women: Don\u2019t overplan your life\n\nNot every life move, like a great job opportunity, will happen exactly when you want it to, Wojcicki noted.\n\n\u201cJoining Google when I was four months pregnant was a bit of a leap, but sometimes you have to do the right thing for you right now,\u201d she told Glamour magazine.\n\n\\\"After my kids go to bed, I check email. It's about having that balance,\\\" Wojcicki tells Shriver. Today\n\n5. Her advice to working moms: It gets easier\n\n\n\nWomen who worry about balancing family and career should remember that \u201cthe really hectic period\u201d of having a child is fairly brief, she advised.\n\n\"Having a child is a big life change but\u2026 you can get through it,\u201d Wojcicki told Glamour.\n\n6. Her mom supports her work, so do her kids\n\n\u201cMy mom is a high school teacher, so she would tell me, 'Oh, the students liked the video you posted today. Oh, the students didn't like the video that you posted today.' As though I, personally, posted a video!\" she told Fast Company.\n\nHer children also alert her to fun clips.\n\n\"My kids will say, 'Oh mom there's this video I saw, I really think you should know about it,'\" Wojcicki told TODAY.\n\nWojcicki says she's glad she stuck it out as a tech executive and says that as time goes on it does get easier. Today\n\n7. People asked if she would quit when she got pregnant \u2014 at first\n\n\n\nWojcicki is glad she didn\u2019t give up her very successful and demanding career when she had her second child \u2013 though many colleagues around her assumed she would.\n\n\u201cI won't say it was easy, but I decided I'd make it work because I really believed in Google's potential. When you're a junior-level woman and get pregnant, people always ask if you'll quit. But no one asks me that now,\u201d she told USA Today.\n\nFollow A. Pawlowski on Google+ and Twitter.\n\n"}

With the passing of the gavel, she became the first woman to hold the Speaker of the House position, as well as the only woman to get that close the presidency. After the Vice President, she was now second in line via the presidential order of succession. Pelosi became Speaker again in 2018.\n\nGroundbreaking Women in Politics\n\n\u201cIt is an historic moment for the Congress, and a historic moment for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited over 200 years,\u201d Pelosi said after receiving the gavel. \u201cFor our daughters and granddaughters, today we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s Congressional career began 20 years before, when she was one of only 25 women who served in both the House and the Senate. She became the Democratic whip in 2001 and served as the minority leader between 2003 and her election as speaker in 2007. In 2002, she was one of the House members to vote against President George W. Bush\u2019s request to use military force in Iraq.\n\nDuring her first two terms as Speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011, she developed a reputation as a tireless fundraiser and a successful securer of votes within her caucus. Her terms as speaker also coincided with Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential term, and Pelosi was instrumental on organizing House votes for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDuring the 2010 midterms, the National Republican Congressional Committee cited her in 70 percent of its ads. The Democrats lost their House majority that election and Pelosi returned to her position as minority leader. After Democrats reclaimed the House in the 2018 midterms, she received her party\u2019s nomination to be its official candidate for Speaker of the House.

McCarthy told reporters he would not make another run for speaker.\n\"I fought for what I believe in,\" McCarthy said. \"I believe I can continue to fight, but maybe in a different manner.\"\nThe House looked set to go leaderless for at least a week, as multiple Republicans said they planned to meet on Oct. 10 to discuss possible McCarthy successors, with a vote on a new speaker planned for Oct. 11.\nTuesday's rebellion was led by Representative Matt Gaetz, a far-right Republican from Florida and McCarthy antagonist who finally turned on the speaker after he on Saturday relied on Democratic votes to help pass a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown.\n\"Kevin McCarthy is a creature of the swamp. He has risen to power by collecting special interest money and redistributing that money in exchange for favors. We are breaking the fever now,\" Gaetz told reporters after the vote.\nIt was the latest moment of high drama in a year when the Republican-controlled House brought Washington to the brink of a catastrophic default on U.S. debt of $31.4 trillion and a partial government shutdown.\nRepublicans control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority, meaning they can afford to lose no more than five votes if Democrats unite in opposition.\nMcCarthy's ouster as speaker brings legislative activity in the House to a halt, with another government shutdown deadline looming Nov. 17 if Congress does not extend funding.\nThe White House said it hoped the House would move swiftly to choose a replacement speaker, a position second in line to the presidency after the vice president.\n\nUNCHARTED WATERS\nThe vote left Congress in uncharted waters as it scrambles to update farm-subsidy and nutrition programs, pass government funding bills and consider further aid to Ukraine.\nIt was unclear who would succeed McCarthy.\nMcCarthy had repeatedly angered Democrats in recent weeks, including by launching an impeachment inquiry into Biden and on Saturday by giving them little time to read a stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown that he needed their votes to pass.\nDemocrats could have saved McCarthy but, after considering it, said they would not help Republicans resolve their own problems.\nOther Republican leaders like Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer could possibly be candidates, though neither has publicly expressed interest. Representative Patrick McHenry was named to the post on a temporary basis.\nThe last two Republican speakers, Paul Ryan and John Boehner, retired from Congress after clashes with their right wing.\nIn debate on the House floor, Gaetz and a handful of allies criticized McCarthy for relying on Democratic votes to pass temporary funding that headed off a partial government shutdown.\n\"We need a speaker who will fight for something - anything - other than staying on as speaker,\" said Republican Representative Bob Good.\nRepresentative Nancy Mace told reporters she voted to remove McCarthy as speaker because he broke promises to her on improving access to birth control and supporting a bill she wrote on rape kits.\n\"I've made deals with Kevin McCarthy, with the speaker, that he has not kept to help women in this country,\" Mace said. \"We have done nothing for them.\"\nMcCarthy's supporters, including some of the chamber's most vocal conservatives, said McCarthy had successfully limited spending and advanced other conservative priorities even though Democrats control the White House and the Senate.\n\"Think long and hard before you plunge us into chaos, because that's where we're headed,\" said Republican Representative Tom Cole.\n\nNO DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT\nDemocrats said they viewed McCarthy as untrustworthy after he broke a May agreement on spending with Biden.\n\"Let them wallow in their pigsty of incompetence,\" Representative Pramila Jayapal told reporters before the vote.\nGaetz was one of more than a dozen Republicans who repeatedly voted against McCarthy's bid for speaker in January. McCarthy ultimately secured the gavel after 15 rounds of voting over four days. To win the job, McCarthy agreed to rules that made it easier to challenge his leadership.\nMcCarthy supporters have said Gaetz was motivated by a hunger for publicity, a chance to win higher office or resentment over an ongoing ethics probe into possible sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.\nGaetz has denied wrongdoing and said he is not motivated by a dislike of McCarthy.\n\"This isn't a critique of the individual - it's a critique of the job. The job hasn't been done,\" he said."}

Before joining Gallim Dance, she was senior manager of finance and planning and then project director at the Museum of Modern Art, where she managed a $145 million operating budget.\n\nHodges is currently executive director of Gallim Dance, a New York-based contemporary dance company that performed at the Institute of Contemporary Art in January.\n\nBoston Ballet announced Tuesday the appointment of Meredith (Max) Hodges as the company\u2019s new executive director. She succeeds Barry Hughson, who left the company in January to become executive director of the National Ballet of Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking by phone from London, Hodges recalled meeting Jack Meyer, chairman of Boston Ballet\u2019s board of trustees, in 2010 when she was a student at Harvard Business School. \u201cI just remember being very excited about the Ballet\u2019s tremendous artistic success,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that there were really smart people at the organization and at the board, and that was my first encounter with the company\u2019s leadership.\u201d\n\nBoston Ballet artistic director Mikko Nissinen said the company talked to about 10 candidates. He\u2019s not concerned about Hodges\u2019s lack of a ballet background. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a question of the individual, of finding the right person with the right DNA.\u201d\n\nHe described Hodges as \u201ca match for the organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a forward-thinking, quite aggressive organization. We act fast, and when we identify something, we go for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not looking for business as usual \u2014 you know, let\u2019s do steady little improvement in five years. This is an individual who is extremely bright and is also a great people person. And that is important with the donors, and for building teams in the organization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes it matter that she\u2019s spent eight years in Boston? \u201cOf course it helps,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter that much. She is hungry. This is her dream job. That kind of uranium energy is exactly what you want. I sometimes joke that I\u2019m the Energizer Bunny who can\u2019t find the off switch. I\u2019m always going and going and going and doing and doing and doing. So I think it\u2019s quite a wonderful match.\u201d\n\nNissinen, the Ballet\u2019s artistic director since 2001, renewed his contract last month for five more years.\n\nHodges cited her years of experience at MoMA \u201cin a very large and complex organization run at the highest standards of excellence in scale and scope and complexity.\u201d And of her time with Gallim, she said, \u201cI think being part of a small company has given me tremendous exposure to the breadth of activity that happens at a dance company: marketing, development, touring, board development, really being hands-on in all those elements.\u201d\n\nShe was familiar with the Ballet during her years in Boston. She remembers with particular fondness seeing Nissinen\u2019s first \u201cSwan Lake\u201d with the company, in 2004.\n\nBut it\u2019s what Hodges calls her \u201cpassion\u201d that comes through in conversation. \u201cWhat really struck me about this opportunity,\u201d she said, \u201cwas the world-class art and also the world-class ambition on the part of Mikko and the board and throughout the organization to deliver excellence and innovation at the highest level. Boston Ballet is one of the best dance and ballet companies in the world, and it\u2019s on the rise. Mikko is fantastic and wants to take Boston Ballet to the top and showcase it across the spectrum of classical and contemporary dance. I\u2019m very excited to have the role of supporting that artistic vision.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s also excited about returning. \u201cI know and love Boston very well, and I\u2019m very eager to come back.\u201d Apart from her new position, what is she most looking forward to? \u201cFlour Bakery,\u201d she says. \u201cFenway Park. That moment when you\u2019re riding the Red Line between Charles/MGH and MIT and you pull above ground and the river is full of sailboats. I miss that moment.\u201d\n\nHughson had been executive director of the Boston Ballet since 2009. During his tenure, he steered the $10 million Clean Slate Fund campaign, which retired the company\u2019s debt. He also negotiated the land lease for the company\u2019s Clarendon Street headquarters, and in 2011 he oversaw the $3 million renovation there.\n\nJeffrey Gantz can be reached at jeffreymgantz@gmail.com."}

Oldman reportedly sold off his Hollywood-pedigreed Los Feliz mansion to Hudgens and her longtime boyfriend, Austin Butler, for just under $5 million, a substantial gain considering Oldman originally purchased the home for a bit below $2.9 million back in 2011. Because the deal was done off-market, it\u2019s unclear as to whether or not, or to what extent, Oldman has updated or renovated the home, but according to records, much of the 3,168-square-foot Georgian Colonial house has remained intact. The house is comprised of three bedrooms and four bathrooms, with a separate one-bed, one-bath guesthouse that sits atop a detached two-car garage. Secured gates and a thick hedge help to provide ample privacy for the home (likely a perk for tabloid favorites Hudgens and Butler), which sits on a nearly half-acre of land.\n\nAt the time of Oldman\u2019s purchase, the home was almost entirely covered in ivy, with a modest entrance hall boasting sunny yellow wallpaper and dark polished wood floors as well as set of wooden stairs leading up and away from the front foyer. A living room off to one side features oversize floor-to-ceiling French windows along one wall and a grand piano tucked away in one corner, while a formal dining room located toward the back of the home gets a bit of glitz from a crystal chandelier hanging from the center of the room. The spaces deep blue walls and bright yellow curtains making for a sharp aesthetic contrast. The chef\u2019s kitchen is open and airy, with exposed wood beam ceilings and a butcher\u2019s block grounding the space. The upstairs master bedroom comes with its own en-suite bath comprising a deep soaking tub and separate steam shower, as well as a walk-in closet perfect for wardrobe changes. Out back, there are a number of expansive terraces and a grand sweep of lawn lined with mature gardens and a small citrus grove; a glittering swimming pool and spa set help to round out the outdoor offerings. At present, Oldman primarily resides in Palm Springs, California, while Hudgens also owns a sprawling Mediterranean residence in nearby Studio City, which she purchased for just under $2.9 million back in 2008.\n\nRelated: Demi Lovato Is Renting Her Hollywood Hills Home for $35,000 a Month"}

Artist and senior lecturer in fine art at the University of Worcester S Mark Gubb reports.\n\nI arrived in to M\u00fcnster on a warm and sunny afternoon, blisters slightly rested after a three-hour train ride from Kassel and two days schlepping around Documenta 14. An immediate right turn out of the station took me through a tunnel under the train tracks. The pedestrian crowds, mixed with a busker\u2019s drumbeat, made me feel like I was at a festival, en route between stages. It quickly became apparent there was no busker and the drums I could hear were coming from speakers set high on the walls.\n\nThis was a work by Emeka Ogboh, who has also brewed a beer, fermented to the sounds of the city of Lagos, available at a few bars and venues around town. The artist is interested in the potential for sound to inscribe itself on to space and matter and the work provided a shifted perspective on a fairly mundane activity, momentarily lifting me out of the practicality of my situation and transporting me, psychologically, somewhere culturally richer and more active.\n\nAs a public intervention, Ogboh\u2019s piece could easily be missed by the pedestrians and cyclists doing their best to avoid each other. So often, this is how the once every ten years Skulptur Projekte M\u00fcnster works \u2013 quite imposing sculptures and installations are upon you before you even realise.\n\nWith German curator Kasper Konig at the helm as artistic director, this fifth edition of the project contains new works by around 35 artists, some with pieces over multiple sites and some working collaboratively. Alongside this are the permanent works from a similar number of artists, gradually collected over previous editions, so there\u2019s a lot to look out for as you wander the pretty streets and parks of this north east German city.\n\nBy the project\u2019s nature, there\u2019s no over-arching curatorial theme or thread \u2013 it\u2019s simply a collection of works responding to the site and situation in which they are found. In saying that, politics abounds and the works are given the freedom to stand on their own two feet, providing a series of unique experiences drawn together under this once-a-decade banner.\n\nThe scale and nature of the city lends itself very well to the project. It\u2019s quite compact, has a mixture of parkland and water that run around the centre, and it\u2019s nice and flat (unlike Kassel). So while the city provides an ideal backdrop and context for the artworks, the artworks also take you on a literal journey, highlighting the best of what this little city has to offer.\n\nAs artists always do, the definition of what can be classed as a piece of sculpture on a trail is pushed to its limits, so certain works are only accessible under certain conditions, or at certain times, while others utilise spaces to provide experiences more recognisable as sculptural installations than stand-alone sculpture. Part of me wonders whether this may, in part, be due to the fact that many of the best sites are now taken up by the permanent works, and no-one really wants to put themselves in direct competition with an Oldenburg, a Serra, or a Nauman, do they?\n\nThis year\u2019s project provides an array of experiences beyond that of simply viewing: you can get a tattoo (Michael Smith), walk across the water in the harbour (Ay\u015fe Erkmen), get lost in an apartment (Gregor Schnieder), walk through the muddy bed of an excavated ice-rink (Pierre Huyghe) or hang out by an art-pond in the park (Nicole Eisenman).\n\nThe official app is very useful, if you can afford to have data roaming switched on, as it pings up notifications when you\u2019re in the vicinity of past and present works.\n\nLara Favaretto \u2013 Momentary Monument: The Stone\n\nI\u2019d barely stepped off the bus when my app informed me this work by Lara Favaretto was nearby. Having read about it I wasn\u2019t so interested, but the crowd gathered around it drew me over to what proved to be a surprisingly engaging piece. Presented is a large granite block, excavation marks scarring its sides and instantly recognisable as the kind of monolithic piece of material we so often see deposited in municipal centres as artworks or monuments.\n\nWhat makes this different is a slot cut in to one face. Further investigation reveals that the block has been hollowed out and the slot is an invitation to deposit money. This seems entirely in keeping with the visitor tradition of throwing coins in to fountains and other bodies of water and there\u2019s a pleasing depth, in a physical and audio sense, to the slide of the coins as they head down in to the rock\u2019s interior.\n\nAt the end of the project the plan is for the granite to be repurposed and the money collected donated to the Buren Prisoners Aid Association, to help refugees facing deportation.\n\nAram Bartholl \u2013 12V, 5V, 3V\n\nOne of the constant pleasures and frustrations of the project is following the mostly excellent map, only to struggle in locating the artwork. The first piece of Aram Bartholl\u2019s I went looking for, one of three, proved to be such a challenge. I\u2019d nearly given up when some people emerging from an underpass hinted at its location.\n\nOnce inside, the underpass is lit by a series of chandelier-type lights hanging from the ceiling. Each ring contains a collection of burning tea-lights. However, it\u2019s not the light these give off that\u2019s of concern but the heat, which is converted directly in to electricity that powers rings of LEDs to illuminate the space.\n\nOn one level a fairly simple, and arguably pointless, display of classroom science \u2013 you could ask why convert the heat to light when then tea-lights already give off light? But that would be to miss the point and beauty entirely and these UFO-come-chandelier sculptures really are quite beautiful.\n\nThe other two works similarly engage with this conversion of fire and heat to electricity, and near the Pumpenhaus provide the opportunity for you to charge your mobile phone while taking a break or visiting the work of Gintersdorfer/Kla\u03b2en.\n\nHito Steyerl \u2013 HellYeahWeFuckDie\n\nHito Steyerl is one of those artists who\u2019s cheated on the sculpture trail and gone for a full installation in the foyer of the LBS savings bank on the edge of M\u00fcnster\u2019s green promenade. That said, it\u2019s an entirely fitting site for a work that, on first glance, feels quite clinical and distancing but quickly reveals a humour and dystopian critique of our relationship with technology.\n\nVideos of our long-proposed technological-saviours, human-shaped robots, contain footage \u2013 actual and simulated \u2013 of our auto-selves undergoing tests to see how well they withstand being pushed over or having things thrown at them. Not so well it would appear.\n\nDotted around the space are three-dimensional renderings of the title, in concrete and illuminated Perspex, bringing a gonzo feel to the whole thing, as though we might be in the lab of a nihilistic technological genius. The calculated layers within the work, driven so much by a cold-pragmatism, come together in the sum-of-their-parts to reveal something that could only be constructed by a living, breathing, illogical, human brain.\n\nThomas Sch\u00fctte \u2013 Nuclear Temple\n\nAcross the road from Steyerl, nestled just inside the greenery of the promenade, is Thomas Sch\u00fctte\u2019s oxidized-steel Nuclear Temple. This is a metal dome that feels like an architectural proposition or model and is a nice partner work to Steyerl. As busy and anxious as Steyerl\u2019s work is, there\u2019s a calm simplicity to this piece that can be read in many ways, one of which must surely be a future vision of a post-nuclear age, in every interpretation of the phrase. Whereas Steyerl revels in the complexities of how technology and man fit together or not, this work contains a very human proposition that, once again, may be the legacy of our illogical human brains.\n\nAy\u015fe Erkmen \u2013 On Water\n\nOn arriving at the harbour, streams of people are seemingly walking on water from one bank to the other. Quite apart from the obvious walking-on-water connection, there\u2019s a religious feeling to this sight, something akin to people bathing in the Ganges or some other such spiritually important body of water. At the same time the work speaks of a pilgrimage or migration and the impossibility of the task being undertaken, were it not for the short walkway that Ay\u015fe Erkmen has introduced just below the surface of the water connecting the two sides of the harbour.\n\nThe opportunity to walk from one side to the other provides an entirely shifted perspective on the usual physical relationship that\u2019s possible within the space, at the same time forcing people in to a communal act or experience. There is unadulterated joy on most people\u2019s faces as they experience this simplest of pleasures \u2013 essentially going for a paddle. The dogs encouraged across by their owners look less sure.\n\nGregor Schnieder \u2013 N.Schmidt, Pferdegasse 19, 48143, M\u00fcnster, Deutschland\n\nGregor Schneider provides an unsettling domestic experience, accessed individually through a door at the side of the LWL-Museum. There\u2019s trepidation in the queue, particularly as the people coming back out don\u2019t necessarily reappear in the order they went in. Up some stairs is an entrance to an empty flat \u2013 empty of other people, furniture or much light. Moving through the two reception rooms the instinct is to look for additional clues to inform the experience before passing in to a bathroom, complete with dripping shower and the urine of the former resident in the un-flushed toilet.\n\nI\u2019ll spare any more detail at risk of being the person telling you that Bruce Willis is a ghost at the end of The Sixth Sense. Suffice to say that Schnieder really is a master at providing an emotionally unsettling experience, without ever falling into the trap of being hammy or shocking. The experience is at once entirely familiar and completely alien, much like a nightmare in a domestic setting.\n\nSkulptur Projekte M\u00fcnster continues until 1 October 2017\n\nImages:\n\n1.

Over the past few years, publications from The New York Times to The Tennessean have added related positions.\n\nNow the Financial Times is jumping on the bandwagon. Earlier this year it hired Ren\u00e9e Kaplan, formerly of marketing agency Havas Worldwide and France 24, as the paper\u2019s first head of audience engagement.\n\nI spoke with Kaplan recently as she finished up her first month on the job. She still has to make a number of hires, but said her team has already begun to influence the FT\u2019s coverage.\n\nThe audience engagement team sits in the newsroom, so when news broke last month that the U.S. Department of Justice had indicted a number of FIFA executives, Kaplan\u2019s group jumped into action by resurfacing old coverage of global soccer\u2019s governing body and creating content exclusively for social media.\n\nRead for free: Fifa moneymaking machine still spins http://t.co/DlQ92OZbaV pic.twitter.com/cqnVhoQB3Z \u2014 Financial Times (@FT) May 29, 2015\n\n\u201cWhen news breaks, the engagement team\u2019s integrated approach [comes into play],\u201d Kaplan told me. \u201cWe are part of the reactive process when thinking about how to cover a story and reach our audiences.\u201d\n\nIn the coming months, Kaplan said her and her team will undertake a number of editorial projects to refine their approach and decide how to expand their ideas to the FT as a whole.\n\nKaplan and I discussed possible projects, the prospects of building the FT\u2019s audience despite its strict paywall, and her other goals in her new position. An edited and condensed transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nJoseph Lichterman: Explain your role. What does it mean to be an audience engagement editor?\n\nRen\u00e9e Kaplan: I think that audience engagement means different things in different parts of the business. What is unique about the role of audience engagement at the FT is that we sit fully in the newsroom. I work across the organization and I have members of my team in practically all the different verticals \u2014 marketing, communications, search, data. Fundamentally, though, I define audience engagement as getting our journalism in front of more audiences and more of the right audiences.\n\nLichterman: So you\u2019re focused on expanding the readership, but also focusing on certain readerships. Which groups do you hope to target?\n\nKaplan: We\u2019re trying to define our own metrics of success: Increasing the audience\u2019s connection with our content, creating more loyal subscribers, growing a sense of loyalty, creating dependence on our content. We\u2019re focusing on our existing subscribers \u2014 what we know about them, what they like, how they want to consume our content. We\u2019re also growing our audiences, thinking about who might be interested in the stories we\u2019re telling in different formats and on different platforms.\n\nLichterman: The FT has a : The FT has a paywall , and I\u2019m curious how that affects the way you approach engagement. Does it limit the way you think about social, for instance?\n\nKaplan: The paywall is integral to our model as a business, and even our model as a brand. Fundamentally, we begin with the premise that people are willing to pay for excellent content. : The paywall is integral to our model as a business, and even our model as a brand. Fundamentally, we begin with the premise that people are willing to pay for excellent content. There are lots of ways to access our content. We have a couple of new developments in terms of expanding our reach. One is \u201cfirst click free,\u201d which allows people accessing our content from most social media platforms to be able to click through and read the story free. We have a new access model, which is a shift from the registration model where you could access a fixed number of stories for free. Essentially now it\u2019s a paid trial, where for one dollar, pound, or euro per month, you get whatever you want. It\u2019s very new, but we\u2019re seeing that users are coming back more frequently. We\u2019re working with the paywall. We\u2019re only as good and as valuable to our readers as our content is good and as our business model is good.\n\nLichterman: Are you working to improve content for shareability?\n\nKaplan: We are thinking about how to optimize our content from its very conception, from the moment of commission. Our engagement strategy is two-pronged. On the one hand, we obviously want to grow traffic. We want to reach more more people and get them to come back to the website or back to our content via whatever platform they\u2019re using. : We are thinking about how to optimize our content from its very conception, from the moment of commission. Our engagement strategy is two-pronged. On the one hand, we obviously want to grow traffic. We want to reach more more people and get them to come back to the website or back to our content via whatever platform they\u2019re using. The second prong of the strategy is to change how we produce and distribute our content and optimize it for reach. That doesn\u2019t mean changing the quality or necessarily even changing the nature of what we\u2019re covering. Our brand and our journalistic mission essentially remain the same. But it does mean optimizing some of our content for different distribution platforms, integrating visual and interactive content from the beginning. It means thinking about ways of storytelling that are actually commissioned for social, rather than adapting text-first to social.\n\nLichterman: Can you give me an example of things that you\u2019ve done this way?\n\nKaplan: It\u2019s very early days. I just came to the job. But there have been a couple of breaking news experiences where we\u2019ve tried to do that. FIFA was a major story, especially for a European-based newspaper. Instead of commissioning a classic series of news and analysis in X number of words for the paper, we thought immediately: What is our forte here? It\u2019s the background information on the financials. It\u2019s a lot of the investigative work we\u2019d already done on FIFA. It\u2019s then finding a way to produce and format that content for the greatest reach. So we produced some visuals, some GIFs, we thought of content that was bespoke for Twitter and social that really put those numbers forward in the most shareable way possible.\n\nLichterman: Is it new for the engagement and social teams to be working with the news desk directly?\n\nKaplan: I think the big shift in the industry, and the particular shift within the FT, is that these development strategies, which had resided more on the marketing-commercial side of the business, are now shifting toward the newsroom. So what before was called a community strategy is now called an engagement strategy and is situated in and reports to the newsroom. That\u2019s very new, and very strategic.\n\nLichterman: Are you building a team? Are folks coming over from the business side to the news side?\n\nKaplan: I\u2019m still staffing. Our social media team had already existed within the newsroom. Our audience and digital strategy editor had been on the commercial side. Our engagement strategist, who is very focused on audience insights and research, has also come over from the commercial side. We have a marketing manager focused on content marketing and media partnerships. I\u2019m bringing in data analysts, an SEO expert, and some social media producers. So the team reflects all the different verticals within the business.\n\nLichterman: Will you be working with the advertising or business side of the paper?\n\nKaplan: There is absolutely no interaction between the revenue side of the business and the editorial side of the business. Our marketing manager thinks about the amplification and distribution of our content \u2014 how to optimize the reach and distribution of content with the help of paid promotion that underlines or accompanies the more organic reach of content.\n\nLichterman: The FT recently announced that it\u2019s adding the : The FT recently announced that it\u2019s adding the \u201ccost-per-hour\u201d advertising . Are you trying to get people to stay on the page longer?\n\nKaplan: Again, my objectives are completely distinct from the advertising objectives. I\u2019m interested in extending our engagement to audiences that we don\u2019t have yet, and intensifying and growing our connection with existing audiences. I don\u2019t have a commercial objective. I have an editorial objective, and an experiential objective, and an interactive objective. : Again, my objectives are completely distinct from the advertising objectives.

I don\u2019t have a commercial objective. I have an editorial objective, and an experiential objective, and an interactive objective. Engagement is measured in different ways for different parts of the business. But there\u2019s no part of no media business that isn\u2019t trying to grow the time our audiences spend with our content. Time spent means a better experience and more loyal users. It means getting the best of our journalism in front of the right audiences. In some ways, time spent is a metric of journalistic impact.\n\nLichterman: The FT has a wide range of content, from : The FT has a wide range of content, from Fast FT to more longform feature stuff on the weekends. How does your approach differ for different products?\n\nKaplan: Strategies for engagement and amplification are very bespoke. One lever of engagement is the intelligence about our audiences \u2014 understanding who the audience is for our weekend content, versus who the audience is for companies, or markets, or global economy, or comment. Those aren\u2019t necessarily all the same people, in the same places, at the same time, on the same platforms.\n\nLichterman: What kind of data are you looking at?\n\nKaplan: We have the data from our website subscribers. But we can also get a lot of data from users on social media, whether that\u2019s geographic, or time-based, understanding what kind of content works best in different parts of the world and at what time of day. That\u2019s mostly analytics we get from Facebook and Google. : We have the data from our website subscribers.

Part of my objective is to create a feedback loop so that the creators of the content, the journalists, and the newsroom understand who is consuming that content and when.\n\nLichterman: There\u2019s been a lot of focus in recent months on publishing directly to other platforms, whether that be Facebook or Snapchat or things like that. [This interview was conducted before Apple announced Apple News.]\n\nKaplan: We\u2019re certainly looking to optimize our strategy on social, partly by focusing on audio and video. We\u2019ve seen some real success with our podcast content and in general with our audio content. Both audio and video are very socially driven strategies.\n\nLichterman: I know it\u2019s early days, but what might we expect to see from your team soon?\n\nKaplan: Once we have a complete team, we\u2019ll probably do projects around some of our longer-term series \u2014 our global economy content and our oil content. We\u2019ll also experiment with some new formats, some live digital events, and also possibly some live bricks-and-mortar events."}

Princeton and Quinnipiac are a set pair; they go on the road together against the same teams and host the same teams for their home games.\n\nAfter some last-minute bus trouble for the Bobcats on Friday, though, they gave the term \u201ctravel partners\u201d an all-new meaning, when they literally rode the bus together to their games against St. Lawrence and Clarkson.\n\n\u201cWe had just loaded the bus and we were on our way to Clarkson for our game,\u201d said Zoe Boyd, a sophomore defender for Quinnipiac. \u201cWe were maybe a couple of minutes from the hotel and our bus pulled over to the side of the road. Everybody has their headphones on and is focused and listening to music, and we\u2019re all kind of like, \u2018What? What is happening?'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bus driver goes, \u2018Coach, the bus is breaking down. The engine is shutting off,'\u201d said Bobcats head coach Cassie Turner.\n\nFor Danielle Marmer, it was pretty much a worst-case scenario. As Quinnipiac\u2019s Director of Player Development and Operations, her itineraries are always meticulously planned. And the number one goal of any road trip is to stay on schedule\u2014especially before a game.\n\n\u201cWe like to arrive at the rink the same set time before every game just to keep things consistent, so there was a slight panic at first for me,\u201d she said.\n\nLuckily, though, Princeton wasn\u2019t far away. As travel partners, they swap opponents every weekend, in this case the Saints and Golden Knights. Appleton Arena and Cheel Arena are so close to each other that for this trip, both the Tigers and Bobcats were staying in the same hotel. That isn\u2019t normally the case, when they\u2019re playing teams a few hours apart from each other.\n\nSo Turner texted Princeton head coach Cara Morey, her former teammate at Brown, to ask for a ride. Morey said yes immediately.\n\nPrinceton hadn\u2019t left the hotel yet for their game against St. Lawrence, so they decided to just pick up the stranded Bobcats and take the bus together.\n\n\u201cThey get ready a little bit earlier than us, so the hardest part was getting my players to get on the bus because they were stranded, and it was cold,\u201d Morey said. \u201cSo the hardest part was getting my players to get in their dress clothes and get on the bus early.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the Bobcats realized they had one other problem to deal with: getting off of the bus. When they broke down, they pulled over right up next to a snow bank, which was packed in hard by the freezing weather. The door to the bus was almost completely blocked from opening.\n\nThe team started looking for something they could use to dig out some of the snow from inside the bus, through the small opening they had. Assistant coach Eddie Ardito used a Lysol can to try and break up some of the rock-hard snow, and make a big enough opening for Marmer to squeeze through.\n\n\u201cI told Eddie to just make as much room as he could, and then I slid out and took the Lysol can and just started banging against the icy snow just trying to make enough room to open the door,\u201d Marmer said. \u201cWe got it about halfway and that\u2019s all we needed to get everyone off once Princeton\u2019s bus arrived.\n\n\u201cI was ankle-deep, shin-deep in snow and I had my dress coat on and dress pants and everything. It was funny.\u201d\n\nWhen you put together your team\u2019s staff, \u201cability to dig a bus door out of a snow bank\u201d isn\u2019t generally the starting criteria you go on. But you definitely want people who will bring a positive attitude and problem-solving to sticky situations, and that\u2019s clearly what Turner has throughout her entire staff.\n\n\u201cI believe that the foundation of your team, the people that your players interact with the most, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive so much of your culture and your mood,\u201d Turner said. \u201cCarrie Gaydos, our athletic trainer, she was the first to stand up and figure out what we needed to do. Danielle\u2019s standing up; Maggie [Pruitt], our SID, is standing up; everyone is there trying to figure out how they\u2019re going to help. Not once was their concern about, \u2018Oh my goodness, I\u2019m wearing my dress shoes,\u2019 none of that.\n\n\u201cOnce we got to the rink, there was a lot of socks going on the glove dryer, but all was good.\u201d\n\nAfter they were finally out, the Bobcats joined Princeton on their bus to head to their respective games. Instead of sitting separately, they mingled with players from the other team\u2014an intentional move on the Tigers\u2019 part.\n\n\u201cI had said, \u2018O.K., you guys double up at the front, because we\u2019re going to get off first,\u2019 and [my players] were like, \u2018No way, we want to sit with them, we want to make new friends.\u2019 And so they were all sprinkled throughout the bus,\u201d Morey said.\n\nThere were plenty of old friends on the bus, too. The coaching staffs are both pretty familiar with each other, for starters. Along with being college teammates, Morey and Turner have both coached with Hockey Canada\u2019s programs. So have Princeton assistant Courtney Kessel and Quinnipiac assistant Amanda Mazzotta. Turner and Princeton assistant Melanie Ruzzi started coaching at the same time and have known each other their entire careers.\n\nThere are also a number of Quinnipiac and Princeton players who suited up together before college. Boyd played for the Mississauga Jr. Chiefs (PWHL) with Princeton goalie Cassie Reale, and with Maggie Connors on Team Canada\u2019s Under-18 Team. At home in the summer, she trains at the same gym as Princeton forwards Kayla and Sarah Fillier.\n\nQuinnipiac forward Lexie Adzija also played with Connors and Sarah Fillier on Canada\u2019s U18 squad. With the Oakville Jr. Hornets (PWHL), she played with current Tigers Annie MacDonald, the Fillier twins, and Stef Wallace.\n\n\u201cI think at first it was a little awkward, I\u2019d say,\u201d said Adzija. \u201cI actually saw Stef first so I ended up sitting with her because we all sat with one of their players and mingled a little bit. It was definitely nice to catch up. And then just a quick hi to the other ones as they were getting off the bus.\u201d\n\nQuinnipiac\u2019s Courtney Vorster and Logan Angers also played on Canada\u2019s 2018 U18 squad with Sarah Fillier and Connors. Wallace suited up for Team BC with Quinnipiac defender Kate Reilly at the 2019 Canada Winter Games. At the 2017 National Women\u2019s Under-18 Championship, they both played with Vorster for Team BC. Reilly played with Connors and Princeton\u2019s Emma Kee at Shattuck-St. Mary\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI got on the bus and I saw all these familiar faces, so it was really nice to just be like, \u2018Hey, how\u2019s it going,\u2019 and just talk to them for a bit,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cThe bus ride was fun. It was just kind of a big joke because like, what are the odds?\u201d\n\nThe Tigers had some bus troubles of their own this trip, too. On their way up to the North Country on Thursday, their bus broke down and they were stranded for a couple of hours waiting for a new one. Between the two teams, they went through a total of six buses this weekend.\n\nAfter they dropped off Princeton at Appleton, the Bobcats drove about another 20 minutes to get to Cheel Arena to play Clarkson. Unsurprisingly, they arrived later than usual, and had to condense their normal warm-up routine to be ready on time for the game.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I usually sit in the rink for about 15 minutes and do a little bit of visualization and go over some goals and stuff before the game, so I actually just did that on the bus ride once we dropped Princeton off,\u201d Adzija said. \u201cWe were so lucky to get to the rink at a decent time and get a good warm up in.\u201d\n\nClearly, there were some sparks of positive energy that carried over for both teams into the evening\u2019s games. Princeton took down St. Lawrence, 4-0, and after all of the day\u2019s trials, Quinnipiac picked up an even bigger upset win against No. 6 Clarkson, 2-1.\n\n\u201cI think when you face adversity and you\u2019re like, \u2018We gotta get through this, we gotta be at our best,\u2019 I think that something different can sometimes be something good,\u201d Turner said.\n\nIt crossed the minds of both coaches after Saturday\u2019s games that maybe carpooling again would have been a good idea. Quinnipiac, with a new bus, drove themselves to their game against St. Lawrence and fell to the Saints, while Princeton dropped its game against Clarkson.\n\nAs a way of saying thanks for the lift, Quinnipiac left Princeton a thank you note and a tray of butter tarts, part of a batch that Turner\u2019s parents brought down from Canada.\n\nTurner says the whole situation speaks to the relationship between not only Princeton and Quinnipiac, but all of the teams in the ECAC.\n\n\u201cIt definitely helps that Cara was my former teammate, but any team in our conference would have done that for anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a camaraderie, and I think it starts with our coaching staffs, and it trickles down through our players. We have such a great respect for one another.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was neat. It was nice because obviously, there\u2019s a chance we play them first round of playoffs,\u201d Morey said. \u201cBut to remember that we\u2019re people first and then rivals second is pretty cool.\u201d"}
{"archive_url": "https://www.qu.edu/magazine/breaking-the-ice-danielle-marmer-makes-history-with-the-bruins/", "source_text": "Breaking the ice: Danielle Marmer makes history with the Bruins\n\nBefore she became the first female coach in the 98-year history of the National Hockey League\u2019s Boston Bruins, Danielle Marmer \u201917, MA \u201921, was a Quinnipiac student at a crossroads.\n\nHockey had led her to this moment, opening so many doors along the way. So why now, halfway through her playing career with the women\u2019s ice hockey team, did it suddenly feel like a door was slamming shut?\n\n\u201cI wanted nothing to do with being at the rink,\u201d Marmer said, recalling a period when dwindling playing time and her lack of a clear role on the Bobcats\u2019 roster made the game joyless.\n\nIn stepped Cassie Turner, then QU\u2019s associate head coach but already laying the foundation for the culture of compassion and player empowerment that would make her one of the premier head coaches in the country.\n\nTurner asked pointedly what Marmer wanted out of her remaining seasons and vowed to help her wring the most from her potential. \u201cAnd my love for hockey came back,\u201d said Marmer, a defensive-minded forward who appeared in 132 career games for the Bobcats from 2013-2017, developing into a beloved \u201cgrinder\u201d among teammates for her willingness to contribute momentum-shifting plays that didn\u2019t always appear in the stat sheet.\n\n\u201cHer biggest impact was behind the scenes and how she navigated creating a phenomenal team environment,\u201d Turner said. \u201cShe understood that there were other people feeling the way she felt, and so she really found a way to create an inclusive environment and pass it forward. When I reflect on what she did as a leader, it lasted and continued to ripple through our team for years to come.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before fate and Coach Turner conspired again to present Marmer with another inflection point in a promising coaching career.\n\nAfter serving in a player development role specifically devised for her on Turner\u2019s staff, Marmer was looking to enhance her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Turner spotted an internship with the Bruins\u2019 scouting department, an assignment at which Marmer so excelled that the storied NHL franchise created a full-time position for her in the summer of 2022.\n\nThe Vermont native who grew up rooting for the Bruins would serve as the team\u2019s new player development and scouting assistant, marking the first time the organization had hired a woman to work in an on-ice capacity. She\u2019s one of six women working in player development across the league, per NHL data released last October. There are more than 100 women working in hockey operations, including six assistant general managers.\n\nMarmer\u2019s appointment in such a sports-mad market drew widespread praise, earning her a congratulatory tweet from tennis legend and lifelong women\u2019s sports advocate Billie Jean King. But the 28-year-old insists she is not a trailblazer; it\u2019s more apt, she says, to call her a \u201creinforcement\u201d for a wave of long overdue progress in major professional sports.\n\n\u201cThere are women who are doing this \u2014 obviously it's not at the rate of men \u2014 and we want to get more women in that door,\u201d Marmer said. \u201cI just want to do my job really well so that I continue to keep that door open.\u201d\n\nJust say \u2018yes\u2019\n\nKeeping doors open \u2014 and occasionally kicking one down \u2014 is a mantra for Marmer, who was born in Foxboro, Massachusetts, and later relocated to Dorset, Vermont, with her family. The middle child in a trio of sisters who grew up at the rink managed by their mom, Susan, Danielle was just a toddler when she decided that tagging along and watching her older sister Whitney\u2019s figure skating lessons weren\u2019t sufficient.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the genesis of everything,\u201d recalled Susan. \u201cShe was driving me crazy. I approached the coach and told her the situation and she said, \u2018Well, if she wants to be out on the ice, that's the best time to start trying.\u2019 So she went out and probably fell a hundred times. But she kept getting back up and working on it. That\u2019s the way she\u2019s been her whole life.\u201d\n\nThe Marmers had a tiny yet irrepressible competitor on their hands. Danielle\u2019s trademark was an intense focus, whether she was teaching herself to juggle or commanding the respect of her male teammates as the take-charge catcher on her Little League baseball team. She played on boys ice hockey teams until high-level girls developmental teams beckoned, her talent attracting the attention of, among others, future Quinnipiac assistant coach Brent Hill.\n\nAlong the way, Danielle was gathering plenty of material for two key public speaking engagements: first as a senior at the Bobcats\u2019 team banquet, where she implored the younger players to \u201cbe a senior now.\u201d Then this past August, when she was invited back to the Mount Carmel Campus to give the alumni address at the Class of 2026 Welcome Ceremony.\n\nIn a speech that touched on those same themes of urgency and receptiveness to new opportunities, Marmer spoke passionately about how adopting a \u201csay yes\u201d attitude has propelled her to unimaginable heights and could do the same for 1,872 new Bobcats.\n\n\u201cI urge you to get outside of your comfort zone right away, don\u2019t wait to settle in, and start saying yes,\u201d Marmer told the incoming first-year students. \u201cSay yes to joining a club or an intramural sports team, participate in university activities, scream your head off at as many athletic events as you can.\n\n\u201cAnd if staying in your dorm room playing video games and scrolling through TikTok is more your speed, then at least keep the door open so you can accidentally meet people walking by.\u201d\n\nAdjusted for the digital age, that open-door policy can also mean letting the delete key gather dust. Turner \u2014 whose involvement with national teams in her native Canada dates back decades \u2014 would pass along job postings that couldn\u2019t be found on LinkedIn. And Marmer was unbending in her loyalty to her mentor.\n\n\u201cShe always felt like she needed to apply for something I forwarded her \u2014 or give you a reason why she wasn\u2019t going to apply for a job in France, which was kind of funny,\u201d Turner said. But a chance to work for the Bruins? That was a no-brainer for a New England kid who spent the bulk of her childhood on skates.\n\nIt\u2019s a job for which her three-year stint as the Bobcats\u2019 director of player development and hockey operations certainly provided a dress rehearsal. As did her Quinnipiac education. Marmer graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor\u2019s degree in legal studies and returned to earn a master\u2019s degree in strategic communications, acquiring writing and research skills that serve her well as she files meticulous scouting reports on NHL prospects from the road.\n\nPinch-me moments and puck drops\n\nLike a lot of New Englanders of a certain age, Gary Marmer grew up idolizing Bobby Orr, the legendary Bruins defenseman whose iconic post-goal \u201cflight\u201d in the 1970 Stanley Cup finals is immortalized with a bronze statue outside TD Garden in Boston.\n\nSuffice it to say, Danielle\u2019s first year on the job has produced an endless series of surreal encounters for dad and daughter to savor.\n\n\u201cShe has to just kind of go with it and act like it's normal. But you know, maybe inside there's a lot of butterflies going on,\u201d said Gary, who coached all three of his daughters in youth hockey. \u201cI think she\u2019s had a lot of pinch-me moments.\u201d\n\nAfter learning she\u2019d landed the Bruins job in a phone call with general manager Don Sweeney, Danielle headed off to the NHL Draft in Montreal. She soon found herself at development camp, where she would take part in a ritual that would wobble the ankles of even the surest skater \u2014 like any new player, she took a warmup lap in front of the entire team.\n\nBy the time she got to training camp in September, having lunch alongside All-Stars Brad Marchand and David Pastrnak must\u2019ve felt like old hat.\n\nMarmer spends a lot of her time on the road scouting the team\u2019s minor league affiliate, the American Hockey League\u2019s Providence Bruins, along with the various collegiate powerhouses that reside in Boston\u2019s backyard. Her role is unique from others occupied by women in the industry in that it combines film study and in-person scouting assignments with some on-ice drill work.\n\nThrough Feb. 2, the Bruins\u2019 record stood at a sizzling 39-7-5. They have sustained the best start in franchise history \u2014 which includes a 3-2 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Winter Classic at Fenway Park \u2014 and appear poised to hang a seventh Stanley Cup banner.\n\nDays after the Bruins\u2019 dramatic win at the historic venue, the Bobcats were due to skate on the same makeshift rink as part of the Frozen Fenway event. Needing an alumnus to drop the ceremonial first puck at such a prestigious showcase for the program, Turner said she \u201cinstantly\u201d pitched associate athletic director Sarah Fraser on a certain Bruins employee.\n\nThe choice was finalized just as quickly. With snowflakes falling, Marmer stood at center ice wearing a white Bobcats beanie and did the honors, one chapter of her hockey life colliding with another. QU beat Harvard, 3-1, but Marmer\u2019s journey \u2014 from player to coach to torchbearer \u2014 is a more powerful recruiting tool than any result.\n\n\u201cWe have a mindset within our program that we want women to become the absolute best versions of themselves,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd knowing that, along the way, it\u2019s not a direct journey. You\u2019re going to be uncomfortable. You\u2019re going to be in positions where you succeed and positions where you fail.\n\n\u201cI think Danielle is somebody who's been through all of that, and whether she would admit it, I think she now looks at it and says, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m so proud of myself.\u2019 She can look at everything she\u2019s accomplished and everything she\u2019s conquered and say she enjoyed the process. ... There\u2019s never a finish line. You\u2019ve got to enjoy where you are, and I think Danielle has really embodied all of that. We couldn\u2019t be more proud of her.\u201d"}

At the Yale Center for British Art and the Lewis Walpole Library 18th- and 19th- century highlights include paintings and objects that document the history of the Middle East, especially under colonial rule. Sterling Memorial Library offers visual resources from books and periodicals published in Persian, Arabic, and Turkish, while the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library houses numerous scientific manuscripts. Beinecke Library\u2019s renowned rare book and manuscript collections encompass resources from Safavid Shahnama manuscripts to 20th-century field photographs.\n\nDescription of Holdings\n\nYale University Art Gallery (YUAG)\n\nThe YUAG holds extensive objects from the Islamic Middle East and North Africa. With particular strengths in textiles and ceramics, the YUAG also holds many manuscript paintings from early modern Iran and India. The photography department holds a moderate collection of orientalist photography, as well as works by contemporary photographers like Shirin Neshat and Fazal Sheikh. The Modern and Contemporary department holds a selection of works from Middle Eastern diaspora artists, and these holdings are slated to expand as the YUAG aims to widen its global coverage. The collection also includes historical documentation from the archaeological expeditions made in Dura Europos (modern day Syria) and Gerasa (Jordan) in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nYale Center for British Art (YCBA)\n\nThe YCBA features the largest collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. Included among the vast holdings in paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, rare books, and manuscripts are more than one thousand objects that document British travels through the Middle East and North Africa. While often marginalized as simply Orientalist, these objects, despite the imperialistic views of many of their makers, still present excellent primary source material on the 18th- and 19th- century Middle East.\n\nBeinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library\n\nOne of the most renowned rare book and manuscript collections in the Western Hampshire, Beinecke holds extensive and diverse resources in the Middle East, from Shahnama manuscripts from Safavid Iran to photographs of F.T. Marinetti on his visit to Egypt in 1937. Additional material includes calligraphy primers, ketubahs, Qurans and medieval cartographic works. Moreover, Beinecke just acquired (but has not yet catalogued) the Carney photography collection of Orientalist 19th century photography, which even includes some early 20th-century documentary film footage of Egypt and the Levant. Once catalogued and digitized, this will be a highlight of the collection.\n\nCushing/Whitney Medical Library\n\nThe Cushing/Whitney Medical Library holds rare medical manuscripts from around the world, including many from the Middle East. There are 26 fully digitized Persian and Arabic volumes available through AMEEL. These illustrated volumes will be a unique addition to the collection as they are, like the Peabody objects, not primarily categorized as art works, but rather entered Yale\u2019s collection through the medical school.\n\nSterling Memorial Library\n\nThe Middle East collection at Sterling offers visual resources in Middle Eastern books and periodicals published throughout the Middle East in Persian, Arabic, and Turkish. Ranging from Qur\u2019an manuscripts to Arabic movie posters, this is probably the largest and least well-documented of all the collections because the majority of the visual material is embedded within textual sources. Many of these sources are already digitized through the AMEEL system.\n\nYale Peabody Museum of Natural History\n\nIncluded among the Peabody\u2019s vast natural history collection are a small subset of objects from the Islamic world, mostly discovered through archeological digs. Including some interesting examples of medieval and early modern Persianate ceramics, these objects will be particularly interesting within the VR for their diverse provenance and categorization as artifacts instead of art objects.\n\nLewis Walpole Library\n\nHoused in a farmhouse in Farmington, CT, the Lewis Walpole Library is a comprehensive collection of books and manuscripts related to 18th century Britain. Included among these, are a group of representations of the Middle East as imagined in British prints. Highlights include famed caricaturist James GIllray\u2019s \u201cIntercepted Drawings\u201d which satirize Napoleon\u2019s \u201csavants\u201d and their documenting of Egypt during the 1798 military campaign.\n\nAdditional Yale Resources on Artstor\n\n1.

Before this position, I was the associate librarian for digital strategies and innovation and worked on shifting the library\u2019s focus to digital scholarship and teaching. The current position I am in is about creating a unified portfolio of information and technical services with an embedded understanding of user experience. The hope of this project is to bring all of these ongoing services together and provide a more accessible service for all of our users.\n\nUMSI skills at work\n\nUMSI has really informed my work in a lot of ways. For me, the core classes we took in terms of computer interactions and usability have been critical throughout my career. One of those classes I remember is the Economics of Information course. I was surprised to learn it was a required course for all UMSI students, but I am really thankful it was because I use it a lot in my management and leadership role in the library. Additionally, the project work has been really useful since that is pretty much how all work gets done in libraries all over the world.\n\nMotivation for pursuing information\n\nI was getting my master\u2019s degree in history and got a part-time job at the library. That turned into a full-time job where I met other librarians and information professionals. I found the work they were doing really appealing. I enjoyed being a part of research that wasn\u2019t just my research but the research of others as well.\n\nMost valuable UMSI experience\n\nThe internship I did at the Shapiro Library was one of the most rewarding and impactful experiences that I had at UMSI. I really appreciated having the opportunity to work with the undergraduate students at the University of Michigan. I was also a residence hall librarian when that opportunity was still available for library science students and that was really great. Through that experience I was introduced to how to run a complete library, interact with our users, and even the process of cataloging.\n\nFavorite UMSI memory\n\nAs a residence hall librarian, there was an orientation where we created a video that was a spoof of the Blair Witch Project and that was really fun!\n\nAdvice for UMSI students\n\nFor incoming students, take time to explore all the opportunities on campus. Even though it feels like there is a ton to do with classes, take time to explore the extracurricular activities available to make connections.\n\nFor current students, take whatever classes you can around data: use of data, data visualization, data analysis or research data management. It is so important to have a fundamental understanding of how data is used, collected and organized in the field of information even though you may not want to specialize in it."}

{"archive_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/09/21/why-grade-inflation-is-useful/", "source_text": "Grade inflation is just plain bad. Right? Maybe not.\n\nGrade inflation is awful. Giving students higher grades than they earned rewards them with grades they don\u2019t deserve and makes them think they know more than they do. Right? Maybe not. Here is an argument that grade inflation maybe useful in some cases, helping students to persist in school and succeed in areas they otherwise might not have pursued.\n\nThis was written by Zach Bleemer, a postdoctoral fellow at Opportunity Insights at Harvard University and a research associate at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California at Berkeley. Next fall, he will join the Yale School of Management as an assistant professor of economics.\n\nBy Zachary Bleemer\n\nGrades at American high schools and colleges are rising at a faster rate than students\u2019 performance on standardized tests. This \u201cgrade inflation\u201d has generally provoked scorn, including from The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board, which argued in 2018 that \u201cit is not fair to give grades that haven\u2019t been earned, and the people who end up being cheated are the students themselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA series of recent studies by several independent teams of economists, though, have advanced a surprising hypothesis: that in many circumstances, grade inflation may be providing important benefits to many of today\u2019s students.\n\nEveryone agrees that kids should learn more in school. Grade inflation may weaken some students\u2019 incentive to study and could frustrate colleges\u2019 ability to identify well-prepared applicants \u2014 but higher grades may also bolster some students\u2019 confidence and encourage them into rigorous disciplines where they might succeed.\n\nThe distribution of grades is an educational policy choice, and we should evaluate grade inflation in the same way that we evaluate other educational policies: do higher grades improve or hinder the learning and longer-run outcomes of grade-inflated students?\n\nConsider the choice of majoring in science and engineering (STEM) fields. STEM courses tend to award lower average grades than other fields, and female students are more likely than male students to switch their fields of study if they earn low grades in introductory courses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, inflating grades in STEM courses might increase the share of female students earning STEM degrees, narrowing the worrisome gender gap in those majors. Indeed, a recent study of the University of Kentucky presents evidence that equalizing grades in STEM and non-STEM courses would shrink the STEM gender gap by over 10 percent, though the scholars do not estimate changes in how much students learn.\n\nAnother study, conducted by researchers at Brigham Young University and Purdue University, investigates the increase in national college completion rates since the 1990s. After rejecting many possible explanations for this increase \u2014 like better-prepared students or improved student services \u2014 the authors argue that grade inflation appears to play an important role. Students don\u2019t seem to be learning any more or less in their introductory courses, but higher grades may contribute to their increasing college persistence.\n\nThese studies argue that grade inflation may encourage students to stick with their education despite its challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt may still be true that \u201cthe people who end up being cheated are the students themselves.\u201d After all, grade inflation may make it more difficult for students to assess their own level of academic preparation and aptitude, which could lead students to persist along educational tracks that may not best match their talents. This line of argument assumes that students who earn low grades in certain classes may be better off focusing on something else, for their own good, no matter their personal preferences.\n\nMy colleague Aashish Mehta and I recently tested that hypothesis by studying a striking policy implemented by the University of California at Santa Cruz. At UCSC, students are only allowed to major in economics if they earn at least a 2.8 (B-/B) GPA in the major\u2019s introductory courses. While students below the 2.8 threshold are allowed to appeal the department\u2019s decision, most of them end up earning majors in other social sciences instead.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nProfessor Mehta and I focused on students with GPAs very close to the UCSC Economics Department\u2019s 2.8 GPA threshold. Students just below that threshold were pushed toward studying something else while students just above the threshold were allowed into the economics major, even though the two groups of students had similarly low grades in economics. Which students were better off?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out that pushing the lower-GPA students out of economics led them to other majors where they earned higher average grades, but they were no more or less likely to earn a college degree; nearly all of them would have been able to finish UCSC\u2019s economics major within four years. However, the policy had a large impact on students\u2019 employment prospects: economics majors tend to have higher earnings than majors in other fields, and being pushed out of economics decreased lower-GPA students\u2019 early-career wages by almost a third.\n\nIn fact, we find evidence that the wage value of being an economics major would have been even higher for those low-GPA students than it was for the average UCSC economics major. Getting low grades in introductory economics courses appears to have been an indicator that those students had a lot to learn from being economics majors, as opposed to an indicator that they were unable to learn economics. If only the students who had preferred to study economics had been allowed into the major despite their low grades, they could have derived big long-run benefits from that education.\n\nThis suggests another important benefit of grade inflation: that it could help more students stick with their preferred majors \u2014 generally a wise choice economically (even in the humanities!) \u2014 rather than being discouraged by low grades or prohibited by policies like UCSC\u2019s GPA restriction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducation remains valuable for B and C students; it isn\u2019t always true that relegating those students to different classes means that they learn more in school. Since the students who earn lower grades in college courses tend to be from more-disadvantaged backgrounds, and since low-GPA and restricted majors tend to be more lucrative, there is also an important equity component here: grade inflation could help to narrow equity gaps by encouraging disadvantaged students into challenging fields of study despite their lower introductory grades in those fields.\n\nAll of these studies focus on college grades, but the same arguments hold for high schools. Higher grades could mean less discouragement from challenging subjects and maybe even greater confidence and persistence to graduation. While inflated high school grades may make college admissions more challenging, grades remain highly predictive of college preparedness, and admissions offices can adjust to applicants\u2019 higher average GPAs by adjusting their GPA expectations or focusing on class rank.\n\nThe College Board has motivated some concern that grade inflation is greater at affluent high schools, which could potentially limit college access for students from lower-income schools, but this doesn\u2019t appear to be true among the high school graduates headed to selective universities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s some evidence of the opposite effect: since top students at many affluent high schools have already neared the upper bound of possible high school grades, top students from less-affluent schools have been \u201ccatching up\u201d through their own schools\u2019 grade inflation, though it doesn\u2019t appear that those students have been \u201ccatching up\u201d in terms of standardized test scores.\n\nWe have a lot more to learn about the motivational and learning effects of higher or lower grades, and not all grade inflation is created equal: for example, a recent grade-deflation policy at Wellesley had the net effect of increasing enrollment in STEM fields, seen by many as a positive outcome."}

Jack Dorsey, one of the cofounders of the social media start-up, had recently returned to the company as CEO, taking over from Dick Costolo, who had taken Twitter public a couple of years earlier. This wasn\u2019t the first time Dorsey had run Twitter. As I detailed in my book on the early days of Twitter, Hatching Twitter, Dorsey had served as CEO during the company\u2019s nascent years, before being kicked out because he had no idea how to run a company. Evan Williams, Twitter\u2019s other cofounder, took over. Dorsey, incensed by the fact that he had been ousted, then came back to oust Williams, and the CEO musical chairs went on for nearly a decade until Dorsey again returned to lead Twitter during the Trump era. My question for the executives I was meeting with that year was simple: What happens if Dorsey was (once again) unsuccessful in growing Twitter to its full potential? Who would take over next? At the time I was told by the board of Twitter that \u201cThere is no plan B.\u201d It was Jack Dorsey or bust.\n\nOn Monday, five years after that proclamation, Dorsey announced he was resigning from Twitter. Plan B, it turns out, is the company\u2019s chief technology officer, Parag Agrawal. In a resignation letter, Dorsey said, \u201cAfter almost 16 years of having a role at our company\u2026from co-founder to CEO to Chair to Exec Chair to interim-CEO to CEO\u2026I decided it\u2019s finally time for me to leave.\u201d But what changed? Why is Dorsey leaving now? Was he ousted? Or is he \u201cresigning\u201d of his own accord? The answer to those questions varies depending on who you ask.\n\nI spoke to almost half a dozen people familiar with the company\u2019s inner workings, and while they were not directly involved in Dorsey\u2019s \u201cresignation,\u201d these are people who have a deep understanding of the place, and as such theorized that Dorsey is being ousted as CEO, rather than leaving of his own accord. (Twitter itself did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) In 2020, Elliott Management, a hedge fund known for activist investing that controls roughly $48 billion in assets, had purchased $1 billion of Twitter stock and began a campaign to demand changes at Twitter, with a specific goal in mind: getting rid of Dorsey. At the time, Dorsey refused to step down as CEO, using the argument that he was a founder of Twitter, and therefore the only person who could run it, according to people who were familiar with Dorsey\u2019s thinking at the time. Earlier this year, in April, when it was announced that Elliott Management\u2019s activist investor Jesse Cohn was planning to step down from the board of directors, it appeared that Dorsey had survived the Succession-like coup. I then heard rumblings from someone close to Twitter\u2019s board over the summer that there was indeed a CEO search taking place at the company, but I had assumed at the time that it was just theater given that Dorsey has largely been unfireable for the past nearly 16 years, and has always managed to stave off attempts to expel him from the company. In May, Elliott Management increased its holding in Twitter, buying more than $200 million of stock when the company\u2019s value fell by more than 15% following a sluggish earnings report. Looking back now, it appeared that Dorsey\u2019s death knell had been rung.\n\nWhile one former high-level employee at Twitter believes that Dorsey may have indeed decided to step down of his own accord, the employee acknowledged that his resignation was handled in a very peculiar way. Rather than have an overlapping transitionary period, where Dorsey trains his replacement, the switch is happening immediately, which the former employee said was very \u201cweird.\u201d For others, what\u2019s most telling that Dorsey likely didn\u2019t have much of a say in this matter is that he is not only stepping down as CEO, effective immediately, but that he is leaving the board of Twitter in May. In the past, when founders and CEOs step down, they often stick around indefinitely to help guide the direction of a company, given their own understanding of a business. Bill Gates remained on the board of Microsoft about 20 years after he resigned as CEO, and only left when the board opened an investigation into a prior romantic relationship he had with a Microsoft employee that was deemed inappropriate. Eric Schmidt and Larry Page, both of whom served as CEOs of Google, stayed on the board for some time after stepping down (Page is still on the board of Alphabet). Even Twitter\u2019s cofounder, Evan Williams, remained on the board of Twitter for over a decade after he was pushed out by Dorsey. The problem with keeping Dorsey on the board now is that each time he has stepped down in a leadership role at the company in the past, and in turn stayed on the company\u2019s board, he has managed to connive his way back to becoming CEO. The only true way to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen again, one former employee theorized to me, is to cut him out of the company entirely.\n\nAnother person close to the company and to the board told me that the likely scenario of why Dorsey is leaving so abruptly is somewhere in the middle of a resignation and being forced out. \u201cTwo years ago, Jack was friends with everyone on the board,\u201d this person said, and they weren\u2019t going to do anything to hold him accountable for the company\u2019s languid performance over the past few years. \u201cI think it was a bit embarrassing for everyone when Elliott Management showed up and said it wasn\u2019t acceptable for a public company of this size to not have a full-time CEO,\u201d the person told me. \u201cTwo years later, and I think Jack knew that his performance as CEO wasn\u2019t up to par, and that while he had held off being ousted before, he knew that it was only a matter of time before other investors, or his new board, would force him out as CEO.\u201d In other words, Dorsey wasn\u2019t pushed out at this very moment, but he saw the writing on the wall.\n\nFor Dorsey, leaving the company he has spent almost 16 years fighting tooth and nail to stay a part of might be the best thing that could happen to him\u2014and to Twitter. Dorsey\u2019s stature over the past five years has skyrocketed in both wealth and attention. When I first started covering him and the company, Dorsey lived in a tiny studio in the Mission district of San Francisco and was living paycheck to paycheck, barely able to afford new clothes. Now he\u2019s worth nearly an estimated $12 billion, partially from his Twitter shares, his shares in Square, and Bitcoin acquisitions he has made over the years. He no longer socializes with subordinates at Twitter and Square, people he was friends with for many years, but is a part of the elite A-list celebrity set, going boating with Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, or vacationing with Sean Penn and the Israeli venture capitalist Vivi Nevo in Hawaii. And his latest obsession seems to be with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, not necessarily the future of Twitter.\n\nAs for Dorsey\u2019s replacement, Parag Agrawal, while he won\u2019t be facing Dorsey trying to oust him as CEO\u2014one hopes\u2014Agrawal will face an insurmountable number of challenges at the helm of Twitter. While the company has grown its user base in recent quarters, Twitter has around 211 million daily monetizable users, compared to Facebook\u2019s 2.91 billion monthly active users. Twitter is the smallest social platform of the big five\u2014including Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram\u2014and is constantly roiled in scandals over everything from harassment to free speech to whether Donald Trump deserves to maintain an account there. Agrawal will also be the fifth CEO of a company that is barely 16 years old; whereas the median tenure of a CEO of one of the world\u2019s largest 2,500 public companies is around five years, almost 20% of those CEOs remain in their position for 10 or more years. At Twitter, that average is around three years. While I haven\u2019t spoken to the Twitter board of directors directly, having covered the company through its continual upheavals since it was hatched in 2006, I can only assume that there is no plan C. It\u2019s now Agrawal, or bust.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n\u2014 Trump\u2019s Disastrous Tulsa Rally Was Even More of a Train Wreck Than Originally Thought\n\n\u2014 Top Kamala Harris Aide Heads for the Exit\n\n\u2014 Inside the Supply-Chain Snafu That Could Wreck Your Holiday Plans\n\n\u2014 The Eric Adams Era Has the Makings of a Tabloid Gold Mine\n\n\u2014 Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s Trial Opens a New Chapter in Heinous Jeffrey Epstein Saga\n\n\u2014 Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s New CEO, Enters the Ring\n\n\u2014 Rupert Murdoch Tells Trump to STFU About 2020\n\n\u2014 Did the Lingerie Business Make Jeffrey Epstein Possible?\n\n\u2014 From the Archive: The Second Coming\n\n\u2014 Not a subscriber?

It\u2019s Pretty Obvious.\n\nPHOENIX \u2014 Walk the streets of Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s old stomping grounds, Phoenix\u2019s artsy Roosevelt Row, on a busy Friday night and you might see a dozen or so Kyrsten Sinemas, none of them flattering.\n\nA local dance crew calling itself the Moderate Pixie Dream Girls, whose members dress in pink tutus and purple party wigs, perform on local street corners to protest the Arizona senator\u2019s opposition to increasing the minimum wage or her resistance to immigration reform.\n\nStickers at the hipster coffee shop anchoring the neighborhood feature her face on a milk carton reading \u201cMissing: Last seen defending the Jim Crow filibuster.\u201d\n\nAt the national level, though, Sinema\u2019s brand isn\u2019t so much progressive betrayal as raw confusion. When Saturday Night Live parodied Sinema as one of two Democrats opposing President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic agenda, the writers knew how to have fun with her biographical details \u2014 \u201cas a wine-drinking bisexual triathlete, I know what the average American wants\u201d \u2014 and her fashion sense (\u201call the Scooby Doo characters at the same time\u201d). But when it came to what motivates her, they drew a blank, settling simply on \u201cchaos.\u201d\n\nChaos isn\u2019t a bad way to describe her impact in Washington right now; she\u2019s not only holding up her own party\u2019s biggest national priority, but she\u2019s famously unclear about her reasons why. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), the other most-intransigent Democrat, can\u2019t stop talking about his motives. Sinema isn\u2019t even calling her friends. She\u2019s rocketed into the national zeitgeist as an enigma, one of the least understood politicians in Washington.\n\nBack home, some of her oldest allies \u2014 as well as critics \u2014 have an insight for the Democrats who are trying to corral her, and it\u2019s not necessarily a comfortable one: Get used to it. Politically, Sinema\u2019s career looks like she experienced a personal revolution; she began as a left-wing agitator and ended up as a Republican-friendly moderate. But in Arizona, many people see those positions as almost beside the point: For them, Sinema is better understood in terms of pure ambition, and the constant triangulation needed to hold office in a purple state that fancies itself charting an independent course, whatever that requires in the moment. Sinema declined to comment for this report.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s usually the smartest person in the room and she wants to be treated that way,\u201d says Phil Lopes, a former Democratic colleague in the state House of Representatives, who was once a Sinema ally, but no longer.\n\nWhat exactly Sinema stands for appears to be less important. She voted against Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax cuts but now refuses to raise tax rates on the wealthy and corporations; she says tackling climate change is a top priority but reportedly suggested slashing billions of climate dollars in Democrats\u2019 sweeping social spending package (something her office denies).\n\nProgressive activists are furious, with local groups already threatening to fund a primary challenge against her in 2024. Some of her old comrades say Sinema would be better off dropping the \u2018D\u2019 next to her name altogether and returning to her roots as an independent.\n\nBut for those still perplexed about Sinema, her rise offers an object lesson in how to get ahead by flagrantly eschewing loyalty to one\u2019s own party.\n\nThe broad outline of Sinema\u2019s metamorphosis is well-known: A former Green Party activist who protested the Iraq War in a pink tutu, she shifted toward the center as she set her sights on Congress. But the details of Sinema\u2019s transformation lay in her time in the state legislature, where she learned to distance herself from progressives and made alliances with Republicans that she still leans on today.\n\nBack in 2002, the Arizona Democratic Party deemed Sinema \u201ctoo extreme\u201d for the Arizona Legislature in her bid as a lefty independent candidate. But two years later, after adopting the label of Democrat and getting the nod from her new party, she won a seat in the Arizona House of Representatives.\n\nFor the next six years, she served in the state House representing the same Downtown Phoenix district as David Lujan, an era that culminated with him as House minority leader and her as assistant leader. But the first time they met in 2004, she was hesitant to team up with him because he had once been registered as a Republican. She interviewed him first to ensure he was sufficiently progressive \u2014 an irony that\u2019s not lost on him now.\n\n\u201cWe were very much a progressive team,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look at our campaign materials during those years, we ran on a progressive platform and the bills we introduced are pretty progressive. So that\u2019s definitely different than the approach she takes today.\u201d\n\nAs Sinema climbed the ranks into state Democratic leadership, she also learned the art of compromise so well that it began to concern some of her progressive allies and former liberal champions. She also stood out immediately for her ability to make friends with the most conservative Republicans, including now-Rep. Andy Biggs, leader of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, and Russell Pearce, sponsor of Arizona\u2019s SB1070, a controversial 2010 law designed to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nMany of those relationships were strategic, notes Kirk Adams, the former GOP speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives. She buddied up to the people who had the power to help her agenda, and Republicans held strong majorities in the state House and state Senate.\n\n\u201cSome of her caucus-mates were suspicious because she was so friendly with Republicans,\u201d Adams says. \u201cBut there was also a fair amount of jealousy, because if you go back and look at how many bills she got through, I\u2019d be surprised if any other Democrats came close to her.\u201d\n\nThese days, it seems Sinema\u2019s only fans are Republicans \u2014 and one of her biggest might be Biggs.\n\nBiggs was recently captured on video praising Sinema and Manchin for holding up the Biden agenda, while Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds urged Republicans to call their offices and thank them for keeping the filibuster intact.\n\nHer friendship with Biggs was the subject of considerable Capitol intrigue during her days as a state legislator and one of the first big signs that Sinema was changing, says Lopes. Notably, Sinema had helped whip votes for Lopes\u2019 election to be House minority leader in 2006, but two years later was part of the team that toppled him in a leadership coup.\n\n\u201cShe was getting closer and closer to Biggs. They hung out a lot and did things together, and she bragged about that,\u201d he says. \u201cI attribute all of that to a strategy in her head to stay in office. She\u2019ll do anything, anything, to stay in office.\u201d\n\nThat strategy shift included, per Lopes, sponsoring a pair of bills playing to the anti-immigration fervor seizing the state at the time, in the runup to her 2012 bid for Congress. The first measure made small changes to a human trafficking law to allow police to more easily prosecute human smugglers; it ultimately passed both chambers of the legislature unanimously, but it rankled progressives.\n\nThe next year, she came back with a more controversial proposal, which increased the penalty for forgery if forged documents were used in relation to a \u201cdrop house\u201d \u2014 a landing pad for undocumented immigrants brought to the country by smugglers. To get the bill across the finish line, she turned not to her fellow Democrats, but to several conservative anti-immigration stalwarts, including Biggs, who signed on as a co-sponsor.\n\nImmigrant rights groups swarmed on a press conference Sinema held after the bill passed, chanting \u201cno m\u00e1s\u201d \u2014 no more \u2014 until Capitol police arrested four people. But they had made their point: Sinema abruptly ended the press conference and left.\n\nSoon after, Sinema enraged many in her party for refusing to back the recall of Pearce, the then-Senate president who had authored Arizona\u2019s hard-line immigration law. Sinema had been elected to the state Senate in 2010, and she told a group of activists organizing the historic recall effort that she couldn\u2019t help because Pearce was her \u201cboss.\u201d\n\nShe also went on a local news program and declared that Pearce, among the left\u2019s most hated politicians, was a good friend who should also run for Congress. Her spokesperson later said it was a tongue-in-cheek remark meant to convey that she wanted him out of the state Legislature. But to many Latino activists, cozying up to the man who had demonized their communities all to get a few modest bills through the Senate was a bridge too far.\n\nToday, Lopes is part of a group raising money for a potential Democratic challenger to Sinema in 2024, infuriated that she\u2019s serving as a blockade to the Biden agenda.\n\n\u201cThis is our chance to do something really, really meaningful,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd she\u2019s holding that up. What kind of bullshit is that?\u201d\n\nSometimes, Sinema succeeded in co-opting her conservative friends into backing a liberal agenda.\n\nIn 2006, when Sinema was still a true-blue progressive, she asked Jonathan Paton, a Republican legislator from Tucson, to take the lead on her bill ensuring women who breastfeed in public couldn\u2019t be charged with indecent exposure.\n\n\u201cShe was very matter of fact about it: \u2018Look, if I sponsor it, it\u2019s not going to pass. I\u2019ll do all the work, I just need a Republican to sponsor it for me because that\u2019s the way the world works,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Okay, you know, whatever,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t really pay a whole lot of attention to it, to be honest with you, until the day of the hearing.\u201d\n\nHe was shocked when hundreds of women showed up for the hearing \u2014 a mix of what he calls granola hippies and Mormon moms. The bill passed committee with their support, but Paton warned Sinema it still faced opposition within conservative ranks of the Republican Party, particularly from Pearce.\n\n\u201cAnd she looks at me and she says, \u2018I\u2019ll handle Russell,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nSinema drummed up a campaign for moms and higher-ups in the Mormon Church to email Pearce, who is Mormon, to support the bill, and Pearce folded, Paton says.\n\n\u201cI was impressed,\u201d Paton says. \u201cShe was smarter than most people in either party.\u201d\n\nThe two went on to work on a host of other issues together, including the drop house bill that later put Sinema in trouble with members of her own party. But Paton still thinks back to that first project \u2014 the breastfeeding bill that he didn\u2019t really want to sponsor \u2014 as the moment when he understood what a powerhouse Sinema could become.\n\nAll the Washington, D.C. intrigue about why Sinema is holding up Democrats\u2019 legislation is based on a misreading of where the state is politically, Paton adds. It\u2019s an independent, center-right state that can support a Democrat who leans conservative.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say she knows this state at least as well as she knew Russell Pearce,\u201d he says.\n\nEven among her critics, Sinema is widely regarded as among the savviest political operators in Arizona history. She has the book smarts of a lawyer, the emotional intelligence of a social worker and the determination of a triathlete, because she is all of those things.\n\nNobody gets to the U.S. Senate without a healthy dose of ambition and hubris. But her detractors say in that regard, too, she\u2019s off the charts: That she\u2019s only ever cared about herself, that she craves the limelight, that she\u2019s abandoned all principles she once held dear in exchange for power.\n\n\u201cKyrsten is one of the most brilliant people I\u2019ve ever known, if not the most brilliant,\u201d says a former Democratic lawmaker who once was close with her in the legislature and was granted anonymity to speak candidly. That\u2019s what makes her conduct in Washington so disappointing: \u201cI don\u2019t think her motivation for casting the votes that she does today has anything to do with what her actual true beliefs are.\u201d\n\nInstead, the former colleague says her decisions are based on cold hard political calculations \u2014 and a need to feed her hunger for attention, more than power even.\n\n\u201cIf she lost the Senate race and got a TV show on Fox or whatever, I think she\u2019d be just as happy,\u201d the former lawmaker says. \u201cWhat she wants is Cecily Strong to play her on SNL. Anyone who thinks that she was insulted by that doesn\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nOther longtime allies and supporters of Sinema are bewildered.\n\nBack when Sinema unsuccessfully ran for the legislature as an independent, Sandy Bahr, executive director of the Sierra Club Grand Canyon Chapter, was her biggest champion. She helped campaign for Sinema and was there on election night sharing in the devastating loss.\n\nWhen Sinema ran as a Democrat two years later and won, she quickly became one of the Sierra Club\u2019s most reliable votes at the Capitol. For years in Congress, Sinema and Bahr were still close. But these days, Bahr can hardly get a meeting with her, securing a single 5-minute session since Sinema became a senator three years ago.\n\nAnd why, wonders Bahr, is Sinema reportedly pushing to cut $100 billion from funds to fight climate change \u2014 a stance at odds with the view of her own voters based on the polling. Sinema is typically a math whiz when it comes to politics, Bahr says, but in this instance, her calculations seem to be off. A Sinema spokesman denied the report to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really disappointed, and I\u2019m perplexed,\u201d she says, adding that she thinks Sinema still cares deeply about environmental issues. \u201cBut where she\u2019s centering herself seems to have changed.\u201d\n\nOf course, Sinema isn\u2019t the only Democrat standing in the way of passing Biden\u2019s agenda. But politicos and pundits find it much easier to explain away the reservations of Manchin, a longtime moderate whose state Trump won by nearly 40 percentage points last year.\n\nManchin has come in for pressure from the left \u2014 protesters have been kayaking up to his houseboat \u2014 but he has had no problem debating them, even on the water.\n\nSinema, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t been spotted around her old haunts since she was photographed in April flaunting a ring reading, \u201cFuck Off.\u201d She rarely takes questions from the press or her constituents, whether they try to buttonhole her on airplanes or in the bathroom. She doesn\u2019t ham it up with the press like Manchin.\n\nTo Lujan and other former allies, her silence is the most confounding part of her transformation.\n\nAs a state lawmaker, Sinema would sometimes speak at three public events a day and was among the most quoted and quotable lawmakers, he says. But now she\u2019s \u201calmost reclusive.\u201d\n\nFormer Arizona Democratic lawmaker Debbie McCune Davis, a solid progressive who was something of a mentor to Sinema during her early years at the Capitol, says she saw a change once Sinema ascended to Democratic leadership. Suddenly, Sinema was keeping the door open to the payday lending industry and others who were in direct opposition to Democrats\u2019 agenda.\n\n\u201cI watched the evolution take place. And what I saw was a pragmatic side of her that frustrated me a bit, because those were not people who were doing anything good for our community,\u201d she says.\n\nMcCune Davis says Sinema still ultimately voted against the payday lenders, and she doesn\u2019t hold it against Sinema for meeting with them and raising money for Democrats from them. But she, like others, has a hard time reconciling the Sinema she knew with the U.S. senator of today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsettling because you vote for someone because you believe you know what they stand for. And right now, I think people are very confused about what Kyrsten stands for,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t given up on her. But I know people who have.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to talk about Sinema without mentioning John McCain, the \u201cMaverick\u201d Republican who represented Arizona in the Senate for more than 30 years and was frequently at war with his own party.\n\nMcCain faced primary challenges, state GOP censures and hostile crowds any time he faced a room of Republicans \u2014 and that was even before he inflamed the grassroots by taking on Trump.\n\nSinema is said to be eager to inherit McCain\u2019s mantle as an Arizonan with an independent streak; whether intentionally or not, her ostentatious thumbs down on Democrats\u2019 minimum wage boost earlier this year instantly conjured memories of McCain\u2019s own rejection of the GOP Obamacare repeal bill.\n\nRepublicans who have taken a recent shine to Sinema especially like to draw the comparison.\n\n\u201cI know another Arizona senator who faced primary challenges, even really stiff ones, and always came through \u2014 and that was John McCain,\u201d says Adams, the former House speaker. \u201cSo there\u2019s a model\u2026 of success, frankly, of how you can do it.\u201d\n\nBut that comparison, Adams acknowledges, misses the first 20 years of McCain\u2019s history, before Tea Party activists overtook the state Republican Party, when he built up a political machine and passed out favors like Halloween candy.\n\nSinema lacks the same strong relationships with local elected officials that McCain once had, which makes occasionally breaking with the party far more difficult. In addition to quite distinct biographies \u2014 McCain, of course, was a war hero and presidential candidate \u2014 their temperaments couldn\u2019t be more different. Unlike Sinema, McCain would talk to the press for hours at a time. And Sinema doesn\u2019t have the fiery, confrontation-loving spirit that leads one to hold court with critics. Agree with him or not, McCain had a way of making people feel heard, even if not convinced.\n\nSinema has always been a woman apart from her party. She reluctantly adopted the label of Democrat only after realizing it was her path to power. And she largely shed that label in her most recent campaign, opting instead to emphasize her independent voice.\n\nWinning reelection in Arizona won\u2019t be easy for any Democrat, but even most of her critics acknowledge Sinema is well positioned for the general election. The real threat may lie in a primary challenge.\n\nHer support within the party is sinking fast, with recent polls showing her approval rating among Democrats at 25 percent. But her reelection is still three years away, and if she ultimately helps pass Biden\u2019s legislative agenda, rank-and-file voters could grudgingly return.\n\nBut what if she doesn\u2019t, and they don\u2019t? Some Arizona politicos are increasingly floating the idea that she could sidestep her problem with the base entirely by formally quitting the party and running as an independent.\n\n\u201cBy reregistering independent and running for reelection as such, Sinema would take the club out of the hands of progressive hardliners,\u201d Arizona Republic columnist Robert Robb wrote recently. \u201cThe threat to primary her would evaporate. In fact, the harder left the Democratic nominee for the seat turns out to be, the better for Sinema\u2019s chances in a three-way general election.\u201d\n\nThat still sounds like a fantasy to most in the political chattering class here. But it\u2019s one that Democratic state Rep. Robert Meza, one of Sinema\u2019s closest allies from the state legislature and still a supporter, says is possible. In fact, he sees it as the most likely path to victory for Sinema.\n\nLike others, Meza watched with a mix of inspiration and awe as Sinema transformed from self-described \u201cbomb thrower\u201d and \u201cpatron saint of lost causes\u201d into a moderate power-player. She studied the playbook of dozens of winning candidates and campaigns in Arizona, he says, and integrated them \u201clike an artificial intelligence computer absorbing all these different techniques.\u201d\n\nMeza has studied her playbook closely, too, and thinks he knows what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201cI pretty much know her chess game,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s not gonna run it as a Democrat. She\u2019s gonna run it as an independent in Arizona, and she\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nLopes, the Democratic lawmaker who clashed with Sinema in a leadership contest, says he\u2019s not sure he buys that theory. But in a way, it rings true.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll change her stripes,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019ll just do whatever she thinks is the best thing to do right now for her.\u201d"}

Although the pair have yet to address the media frenzy, several news reports seem to confirm the romance.\n\nCamila Morrone dated Leonardo DiCaprio for four years.

DiCaprio had previously been romantically linked to bombshells including Naomi Campbell, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Blake Lively and Nina Agdal, to name a few.\n\nGigi Hadid (left) with her model/reality TV star mother Yolanda. Photo: @gigihadid/Instagram\n\nWhile the new lovebirds have kept a super low profile so far, Hadid fans can\u2019t help but wonder what Gigi\u2019s mum Yolanda makes of it all. Those familiar with the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reality TV star would know that mama Hadid holds her kids to very high standards \u2013 and if we factor in the alleged beef with Gigi\u2019s ex Zayn Malik , it\u2019s no surprise people are curious.\n\nGigi was dating former One Direction star on and off since 2016, but broke up again last year after Malik\u2019s alleged altercation with Gigi\u2019s mum, Yolanda, People magazine reported. Malik denied the accusations of him attacking Yolanda and pled no contest to four counts of summary harassment, according to InTouch Weekly , and a source said \u201cshe [Yolanda] has not and will not forgive Zayn\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about the Hadid-DiCaprio relationship so far:\n\nHow did Leonardo DiCaprio and Gigi Hadid meet?\n\nYolanda Hadid celebrating daughter Gigi\u2019s 25th birthday two years ago.

{"archive_url": "https://www.dal.ca/news/2019/05/16/introducing-dalhousie-s-12th-president.html", "source_text": "Introducing Deep Saini, Dalhousie's 12th president\n\nOn Thursday afternoon (May 16), Dalhousie\u2019s Board of Governors announced that Deep Saini has been appointed as the 12th president and vice-chancellor of Dalhousie University.\n\n\n\nDr. Saini, currently vice-chancellor and president of the University of Canberra in Australia, brings to Dalhousie a compelling blend of national leadership and global perspective. He\u2019s a renowned plant scientist who grew up in India, was educated in Australia and has worked at four of Canada\u2019s leading research universities. Having spent much of the past decade as president or principal of a major university campus, he\u2019s ready and excited to help lead the Dalhousie community into its third century.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am honoured and humbled by the opportunity to serve as the 12th president and vice-chancellor of Dalhousie University,\u201d says Dr. Saini, who will begin his five-year term on January 1, 2020. \u201cThe university\u2019s students, faculty and staff are proudly devoted to the synergy between world-class education and a rich tradition of outstanding research and scholarship. I am thrilled at being given the chance to be part of writing the next chapter of this compelling story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Saini was the unanimous choice of the search committee, chaired by Board of Governors Chair Lawrence Stordy and consisting of representatives from the Board, Senate, students and administration.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe search committee was thrilled and thoroughly impressed by the quality and quantity of candidates who were interested in this opportunity, from around the world \u2014 a testament to Dalhousie\u2019s growing national and international reputation,\u201d says Stordy.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven among this competition, however, Deep truly stood apart. He\u2019s a warm, genuine and inspiring individual ready to build on Dal\u2019s 200 years of achievement and chart a course towards even greater success in our third century ahead.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Saini follows Dalhousie\u2019s 11th President and Vice-Chancellor Richard Florizone, who served from 2013 until 2018, and Peter MacKinnon, presently serving as president in an interim capacity. With MacKinnon\u2019s term set to conclude at the end of June, the Board of Governors will review options for interim leadership for the remainder of 2019 in the coming weeks.\n\nMore info: Presidential Search website\n\n\n\nA global journey\n\n\n\nDr. Saini is not the first Dalhousie president to be born outside of North America; in this respect, he follows inaugural president Thomas McCulloch (Scotland) and Howard Clark (New Zealand). But having grown up in India, a generation removed from poverty, his path to Dalhousie is quite unlike anyone else who\u2019s taken up the mantle of the presidency.\n\nInspired by his father\u2019s example \u2014 a man whose own educational journey transformed his life and that of his family forever \u2014 Dr. Saini pursued higher education, studying botany at the Punjab Agricultural University in Ludhiana, India before moving to Australia to complete a PhD in Plant Physiology at the University of Adelaide. Following graduation, Dr. Saini and his family relocated to Canada to take on a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Alberta. It was the start of an accomplished academic career that would make him a leading researcher in plant biology, eventually becoming director of the Institute de recherche en biologie v\u00e9g\u00e9tale (Plant Biology Research Institute) \u2014 a leading research establishment at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Saini moved into his first senior administrative role, becoming dean of the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo. There, he launched several new programs and increased both operating and facilities funding. He then joined the University of Toronto as principal of the university\u2019s Mississauga campus, leading major internationalization efforts, overseeing a significant facilities expansion and increassing faculty complement by nearly 100 professors.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the three-and-a-half years prior to joining the Dal community this January, he has served as vice-chancellor and president of the University of Canberra, a young university of comparable size and international ranking to Dalhousie. There, he\u2019s led the development and implementation of a new strategic plan positioning the school as a national leader in professional education and experiential learning, mission-oriented research as well as in equity, diversity, inclusion and access.\n\n\n\nHe is fluent in four different languages (English, French, Hindi and his native Punjabi), with a working knowledge of a fifth (Urdu). His awards and recognitions also speak to his diverse impact, including honours from the Canadian Society of Plant Physiologists, Nanjing University, the Sikh Foundation of Canada, the Royal Society of New South Wales, the Punjab Academy of Sciences and the Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce. He was featured in India Abroad's \"2011 Power List\" and is the recipient of a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived a myriad of experiences during my journey \u2014 from sitting cross-legged on a dusty school floor to the administrative \u2018cabinet\u2019 of a global top-20 university, and now to the helm of a rapidly rising young institution in Australia,\u201d says Dr. Saini. \u201cBut the opportunity to return to Canada and become part of Dalhousie\u2019s journey as its president is one I simply could not pass up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired by Dalhousie\n\n\n\nSo why Dalhousie? Well, for one, he says he\u2019s long admired Dal for its quest for global excellence while remaining, first and foremost, a university for its community.\n\n\n\n\u201cDalhousie\u2019s singular commitment to its anchor role in the region\u2019s economic and social development is fittingly matched to its lofty national and global aspirations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a balance that I have espoused throughout my career and will form the cornerstone of my leadership at Dal.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also inspired by Dalhousie\u2019s extensive efforts in recent years to better support a more diverse, inclusive university community.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving come from a humble background where nothing could have predicted that I would someday lead one of Canada\u2019s top universities, Dal\u2019s founding idea of a university that is \u2018open to all\u2019 resonates particularly close to my heart. I can\u2019t wait to get down to work to bring this idea to life in its modern context, positioning Dal\u2019s core value of commitment to equity, diversity, inclusion and access as its key differentiator and competitive advantage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also sees Dal as a \u201crising star\u201d in mission-oriented research \u2014 but one which puts students at the forefront of that mission.\n\n\n\n\u201cStudents are at the heart of the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of a university,\u201d he says. \u201cBuilding upon Dal\u2019s national and international reputation for rich student experience, I look forward to a deep engagement with students, faculty, staff and community to position Dal as the national leader in delivering value to our students and offering a transformative educational and life experience on our four campuses.\u201d\n\n\n\nGetting to know one another\n\n\n\nThat engagement will begin in early June, when Dr. Saini is hoping to make his first visit to campus as President-Elect. It will be a first chance for some in the Dal community to get to know a person who loves listening to music and cooking, and who is a lifelong advocate for fitness and athletics: he played field hockey and track-and-field as a student-athlete, and is now an avid golfer and expects to be a familiar face at Dalplex.\n\n\n\nWhen he moves to campus in January, he will be joined by his wife, Rani. The family also has two grown daughters, Preety and Kavita, and two grandchildren. Dr. Saini says he and his wife are excited to become part of the Halifax community and experience Atlantic Canada to the fullest.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have visited this lovely part of Canada several times and we are thrilled to have the opportunity to now fully immerse ourselves in the life here,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nStordy, having gotten to know Dr. Saini through the search process, is excited about what the future holds for him at Dalhousie.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe joins Dalhousie at a time of tremendous momentum: record enrolment and fundraising, significant renewal of our campuses, and a strong leadership team in place across the university,\u201d he says. \u201cUnder Dr. Saini\u2019s leadership, I\u2019m certain these successes will be just a taste of what Dalhousie\u2019s third century has in store.\u201d"}

These three reports are a dire warning about the consequences of inaction. Climate change is a grave and mounting threat to our wellbeing and a healthy planet.\n\nWe are now busy working to finalise the Synthesis Report with which we will complete the Sixth Assessment Report.\n\nThe climate science is clear; our Physical Science Basis report concludes that:\n\nIt is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change and human influence is making extreme climate events, including heat waves, heavy rainfall, and droughts, more frequent and severe.\n\nHuman activities have warmed the planet at a rate not seen in at least the past 2000 years and we are on course to reaching global warming of 1.5\u00b0C within the next two decades.\n\nOur report on Impact, Adaptation and Vulnerability shows that these levels of warming are a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet and that the next few years offer a rapidly closing window to realize a sustainable, livable future for all.\n\nClimate impacts and risks are becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Multiple climate hazards will occur simultaneously. Climate risks will interact with other threats to compound the overall risk. Risks will cascade across sectors and regions.\n\nEven temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00b0C warming will result in additional severe impacts, some of which will be irreversible.\n\nWe are not on track to achieve a climate resilient, sustainable world. Action on adaptation has increased but progress is uneven and we are not adapting fast enough.\n\nAs the mitigation to climate change report concluded, we are not on track to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Average annual GHG emissions during the last two decades were the highest in human history.\n\nClimate change is already affecting every region on Earth, in multiple ways. The changes we experience will increase with further warming.\n\nHumanity is running out of time to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0 Cover pre-industrial levels\n\nYes, colleagues, we are at crossroads. Our actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to increasing climate risks.\n\nThe IPCC reports throughout this entire cycle focus on solutions.\n\nThere are feasible and effective options we can take to reduce the risks to people and nature, but their effectiveness decreases with increasing warming.\n\nWorldwide action to achieve climate resilient and sustainable development is more urgent than previously assessed.\n\nClimate action has been taken in many countries. There are policies, regulations and market instruments that are proving effective. If these are scaled up along with the climate finance and applied more widely and equitably, they can support deep emissions reductions and stimulate innovation.\n\nMoreover, our latest report shows that there are options available now in all sectors that can at least halve emissions by 2030.\n\nWe have the tools and know-how required to limit warming. The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future.\n\nIn concluding, I wish to remind you, that the next few years will be critical, but there are ways to improve our chances of success. International cooperation is key to achieving ambitious climate goals.\n\nHuman-induced climate change is the result of more than a century of unsustainable energy and land use, lifestyles, and patterns of consumption and production.\n\nClimate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the world, and results in severe impacts in nature.\n\nAccelerated and equitable climate action in mitigating, and adapting to, climate change impacts is critical to sustainable development.\n\nI invite you to reflect on the knowledge we have developed so far which today is stronger than ever to build the decisions to address the climate challenge.\n\nThank you."}
{"archive_url": "https://nwasianweekly.com/2010/09/editorial-a-fond-farewell-to-uw-president-mark-emmert/", "source_text": "Editorial: A fond farewell to UW President Mark Emmert\n\nNext month, University of Washington (UW) President Mark Emmert will leave the UW to lead the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\n\nDuring Emmert\u2019s tenure, the university raised more than $2.68 billion. Called \u201cCampaign UW: Creating Futures,\u201d it was the most successful private fundraiser in the school\u2019s history.\n\nPerhaps this is what most Washingtonians will remember about Emmert. But for us, we will remember his commitment to diversity. Diversity is a word often thrown around casually. Everyone says, \u201cOh, of course diversity is a priority for me.\u201d But as publisher Assunta Ng illustrated in her blog, past UW presidents did not always follow their words with actions like Emmert has.\n\nDuring Emmert\u2019s tenure, 11 honorary degrees were conferred by the UW Board of Regents, five of which were given to people of color. These include Ban Ki-Moon, Quincy Jones, the Dalai Lama, Virginia Beavert, and of course, the Japanese American students of 1941 and 1942.\n\nIn 1942, 449 Japanese Americans were forced to leave the UW following an executive order that led to their internment. Though Congress passed a resolution in 1988, apologizing for and redressing the injustices of the order, it took another 20 years before the interned Japanese Americans would receive their degrees. In May 2008, the former students were given honorary Bachelor of Arts degrees from the university in a ceremony called The Long Journey Home.\n\n\u201cThe most noticeable [trait of Emmert] is his commitment to diversity \u2014 to open, meaningfully, the university to all students, staff, faculty, and administrators based on their individual merit and talent,\u201d said Tetsudan Kashima, UW professor and chair of the The Long Journey Home Committee. \u201cA striking example of this was his enthusiastic reaction to a 2008 proposal to confer UW honorary baccalaureate degrees to 449 Nisei students who were summarily removed from the UW in 1942 on government orders. Asking \u2018Why wasn\u2019t this done earlier?\u2019 President Emmert and the UW, in a moving ceremony \u2026 helped to rectify a past social injustice. The fact that it took decades before the university took this action is not the point. The real lesson is that once it was brought to President Emmert\u2019s attention, he saw the issue and helped to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, of 23 appointments to dean, chancellor, or vice president positions during Emmert\u2019s tenure, there were 11 males appointed and 12 females appointed.\n\nProvost Phyllis Wise will be interim president in Emmert\u2019s place. Replacing her will be interim Provost Mary Lidstrom, the vice provost for research. It will be the first time the UW has had two females in these positions.\n\nWe have no doubt that Emmert will take this enthusiasm for different viewpoints to the NCAA, and we are excited to see how he will shape such an influential organization for the better.\n\n\u201cWe simply must make sure that our athletics programs represent all of the United States and all of our complexity,\u201d Emmert said at the NCAA Champion and Expert Coaches Forums. \u201cWe have to be committed in higher education and intercollegiate athletics to the philosophy of promoting diversity in our work. We have much work to do, and I\u2019m going to help you take that on.\u201d \u2666"}

He ran on a joint ticket with Quebec Independent Sen. Raymonde Saint-Germain, who will serve as a his deputy facilitator.\n\n\"I am honoured to be entrusted with this responsibility and delighted to be working in tandem with Sen. Saint-Germain,\" Woo said in a statement Monday. \"We believe that a strong, coherent and unified group will enhance the ability of members to be effective independent senators, especially on our core function of legislative review.\"\n\nRaymonde Saint-Germain, a former ombudsman in Quebec, has been elected \"deputy facilitator\" of the Independent Senators Group (ISG). (Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press)\n\nWoo sponsored the government's budget bill in the Senate last spring, steering it through a chamber that has become increasingly unpredictable. Some senators sought to split off the government's proposed infrastructure bank, and stop the Liberal government from levying an automatic yearly increase to the alcohol excise duty. Both efforts failed.\n\nPrior to joining the Senate, Woo was a senior fellow in public policy at the Asian Institute of Research at the University of British Columbia, and is the former president of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.\n\nHe has long been a supporter of closer trade ties between Canada and China.\n\nBut his opposition to a motion that would have condemned China for its incursions in the South China Sea prompted some Conservatives to brand him an apologist for the authoritarian regime. Woo strenuously denied those accusations in an interview with CBC News last week.\n\nVoted with government 100% of the time\n\nIn addition to his vocal support for the budget, Woo has been friendly to government legislation on the whole. Woo voted with the government's representative in the Senate, Peter Harder, 100 per cent of the time during the last sitting, according to an analysis compiled by CBC News.\n\nSaint-Germain, appointed alongside Woo to the Senate last November, is a former senior public servant and ombudsperson for Quebec. She voted with Harder 95.8 per cent of the time.\n\nThe ISG \u2014 composed of recently named Trudeau appointees and others who left the Liberal and Conservative caucuses \u2014 is poised to become the largest bloc of senators this fall, when it leapfrogs over the opposition Conservatives.\n\nThe current make up of the Senate is 36 Conservatives, 35 members of the ISG, 16 Liberals and eight non-affiliated members who sit outside of all Senate groups. After a series of retirements and high-profile resignations,10 new senators will be named this fall.\n\nDespite being appointed by a Liberal prime minister, those new senators are expected to join the ranks of the ISG. Trudeau booted Liberals from the national Liberal caucus at the height of the Senate expenses scandal in 2014.\n\nWoo has said, as leader, he will fight for space on Senate committees for Independent senators. He will also push for more money to help staff the ISG secretariat, a group of staff that support the work of Independent senators."}

Schaffner will oversee the museum\u2019s permanent collection, exhibitions, residency program, publications, and scholarship. She began her new role in February 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to have Ingrid Schaffner join Chinati in this newly established and vitally important role,\u201d says Director Jenny Moore. \u201cIt is an exciting time for Chinati. The Museum of Modern Art retrospective brings new perspectives to Donald Judd\u2019s art. Chinati is a place to explore the fullness of Judd\u2019s vision as an artist interested in architecture and design, as a preservationist and an iconoclast. Ingrid is an outstanding curator, highly esteemed in the field for making an incredible range of exhibitions, from expansive surveys to revelatory solo shows. We look forward to having Ingrid\u2019s talent and expertise shape this next phase of Chinati\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Judd\u2019s concept for the Chinati Foundation was curatorial: to permanently site works of art within a dynamic of exhibitions, scholarship, artists residencies, and events,\u201d says Schaffner. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to join Jenny Moore and work with the Chinati team and board of trustees to amplify the capacity of the curatorial to keep us looking and thinking about art, architecture, and the land in Marfa. It is an honor to build on the curatorial legacy established by Judd, work that continued with director emerita Marianne Stockebrand and Rob Weiner, through to the spirit at Chinati today.\u201d\n\nDonald Judd established the Chinati Foundation in 1986 as a museum made by and for artists. Judd\u2019s concept of a new situation for art, where work would be permanently installed on a large scale according to the wishes of the artists themselves, within the context of the distinct light and land of far West Texas, sets Chinati apart as a unique and pioneering institution. Schaffner comes to Chinati with a distinguished history of working closely with artists on the installation and exhibition of their work, including opportunities for artists to act as curators themselves. She is recently the curator of the 57th Carnegie International, America\u2019s most historic survey of contemporary art.\n\nSchaffner joins Chinati at a significant moment. In 2017 the museum completed its first master plan and has launched a comprehensive campaign to fund the priorities it identifies, including buildings and land restoration, meeting the needs of a growing number of visitors, and building Chinati\u2019s endowment. Given the scope of these initiatives, Chinati\u2019s leadership deemed it critically important that a new position be created focused specifically on the museum\u2019s artistic program. Says Moore: \u201cThe curatorial position strengthens Chinati\u2019s mission to preserve and present Judd\u2019s vision for many years to come.\u201d\n\nAbout Ingrid Schaffner\n\nIngrid Schaffner is an American curator and writer, whose work coalesces around themes of archiving and collecting, photography, feminism, and alternate modernisms. As curator of the 2018 Carnegie International, at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Schaffner presented major installations by artists and collectives, including El Anatsui, Alex Da Corte, Zoe Leonard, Postcommodity, and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, along with \u201cDig Where You Stand,\u201d a new look at the museum\u2019s permanent collections by Koyo Kouoh, all within an overarching ethos of \u201cMuseum Joy.\u201d\n\nFrom 2000 through 2015, Schaffner directed the exhibition program as chief curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) at the University of Pennsylvania, where she increased the rigor, diversity, and popular appeal of its program. She facilitated artists as curators, with exhibitions by Kara Walker, Virgil Marti, and Christian Marclay and brought attention to under-recognized artists, little-explored themes, and emerging practices within contemporary art. Her ICA exhibitions include: Barry LeVa, Accumulated Vision; Dirt on Delight: Impulses That Form Clay; Anne Tyng: Inhabiting Geometry; Queer Voice; and Jason Rhoades, Four Roads.\n\nSchaffner\u2019s work has been recognized with awards from the International Art Critics Association (AICA) and grants from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. Schaffner attended the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s Independent Study Program and holds a master\u2019s degree in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.\n\nHer belief that writing about art should be lively and engaging as well as acutely researched informs her many publications, including: Deep Storage: Collecting, Storing, and Archiving in Art (Prestel) and Julien Levy: Portrait of an Art Gallery (MIT Press). She is co-authoring a history of Skowhegan, the summer art program in Maine, founded by artists for artists in 1946.\n\nAbout the Artistic Program at the Chinati Foundation\n\nThe Chinati Foundation opened to the public in 1987. Among the earliest works installed were Donald Judd\u2019s 15 outdoor works in concrete and 100 works in mill aluminum in two converted artillery sheds. The collection and museum have grown to include works of art by thirteen artists sited across thirty-four buildings on 340 acres. Stewarding the permanent collection is at the core of every aspect of Chinati\u2019s artistic program and mission. As curator, Schaffner will work closely with the Chinati team and leadership to develop possibilities to expand the permanent collection, and actively build upon the diverse special exhibitions program, begun by Judd in 1987. Over the years, exhibitions at Chinati have encompassed Guatemalan toys and textiles, drawings by Mondrian and prints by D\u00fcrer, polyurethane foam sculptures by John Chamberlain, as well as a camera obscura by Zoe Leonard, Charlotte Posenenske\u2019s modular cardboard unlimited editions, and a site-specific wall painting by Bridget Riley.\n\nThe annual Chinati Weekend, held every October since 1987, is the occasion of exhibition openings, lectures, and performances. Periodic symposia dedicated to aspects of the museum\u2019s permanent collection have included: Art in the Landscape (1985), Art and Architecture (1998), It\u2019s All in the Fit: The Work of John Chamberlain (2006), Donald Judd\u2019s Writings (2008), and the Chinati Foundation Master Plan (2017), along with related publications. The Chinati Foundation Newsletter is a scholarly journal, published annually.\n\nOther facets of Chinati\u2019s artistic program that Schaffner will oversee include the artist in residence program, also started by Judd, which brings approximately six emerging or established artists to work in Marfa for a period of two to three months, and public programs such as lectures, concerts, and dance and theatrical performances."}

Turnout was 87.4% among 159,320 party members.\n\nIn a characteristically lighthearted acceptance speech, Johnson conceded that even some of his own supporters may \u201cwonder quite what they have done\u201d.\n\nHe claimed the Tory party had historically demonstrated it could \u201cmanage the jostling instincts in the human heart\u201d \u2013 such as those of owning a home and helping the poorest in society.\n\n\u201cToday, at this pivotal moment in our history, we again have to reconcile two noble sets of instincts \u2013 between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support and security and defence between Britain and our European partners; and the simultaneous desire, equally heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country.\u201d\n\nHe reminded his audience of ministers and party staff of his campaign mantra: \u201cDeliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d\n\nSaying \u201csome wag\u201d had pointed out that this spelled \u201cdud\u201d, he joked that the final e \u2013 \u201cE for energise\u201d \u2013 had been left out. \u201cI say to all the doubters: dude, we are going to energise the country!\u201d\n\nAnd Johnson said he would \u201cget Brexit done by 31 October\u201d with a \u201cnew spirit of can-do\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity.\u201d\n\nThe result of the contest was announced by the joint chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Cheryl Gillan. Her colleague, Charles Walker, first urged MPs to be \u201ckinder\u201d to the new leader than they had been to Theresa May.\n\nBrandon Lewis, the Conservative party chair, introduced the slick event at a conference centre in Westminster, saying the race had shown that his party was fundamentally united.\n\nJohnson\u2019s victory was almost immediately welcomed by Donald Trump, who tweeted: \u201cHe will be great!\u201d\n\nBut Johnson was left in no doubt about the opposition he will face from his own benches if he attempts to force through a no-deal Brexit. Alan Duncan quit as a Foreign Office minister on Monday and Anne Milton as education minister on Tuesday, rather than serve under Johnson.\n\nThe chancellor, Philip Hammond, the justice secretary, David Gauke, and the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, are expected to join them on the backbenches after the leadership change.\n\nStewart confirmed he would return to the backbenches on Wednesday, tweeting: \u201cBackbench tomorrow serving Cumbria. Thank you all. More walking!\u201d\n\nJohnson addressed Tory MPs at a meeting of the 1922 Committee on Tuesday afternoon, as well as thanking party staff and his own campaign team.\n\nHe will not take office formally until Wednesday afternoon. May will face her final prime minister\u2019s questions in the House of Commons before tendering her resignation to the Queen.\n\nJohnson will then go to Buckingham Palace for his appointment to be confirmed before being driven to Downing Street to give a speech in front of the black door of No 10.\n\nHe takes charge at a perilous political moment. The Conservatives\u2019 wafer-thin parliamentary working majority is expected to be eroded further next week \u2013 to just two \u2013 if the Liberal Democrats win the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection.\n\nJohnson has faced a furious internal revolt even before arriving in Downing Street, with several key cabinet ministers, including Hammond saying they would resign rather than serve under him.\n\nThey have been alarmed by Johnson\u2019s insistence that he is willing to countenance leaving the European Union without a deal on 31 October, rather than postpone Brexit once again, even if that meant proroguing parliament.\n\nDespite painstaking media management, his campaign has been dogged by a series of controversies, including the revelation that police had been called to a noisy argument at the home he shares with his partner, Carrie Symonds.\n\nJohnson was also blamed by some colleagues, including Duncan for the resignation of the ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, after confidential diplomatic cables about Trump were leaked. Duncan said the former foreign secretary had thrown Darroch \u201cunder a bus\u201d.\n\nHowever, Johnson had been the runaway favourite to become leader after securing support from both wings of the bitterly divided Tory party, from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to the chair of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\nHe is regarded by colleagues as an impressive political campaigner, and the man with the best chance of seeing off the formidable electoral challenge from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, which beat the Tories soundly in May\u2019s European elections.\n\nMay will leave Downing Street on Wednesday after a three-year premiership overwhelmingly defined by the failure of her government to implement Brexit.\n\nJohnson is likely to embark on fresh negotiations with EU leaders and key Brussels decision makers as soon as possible, with a view to securing changes to May\u2019s deal in time for the Halloween deadline.\n\nBut with no secure majority, and Labour determined to demand a referendum on any deal he brings back from Brussels, many MPs believe he could be forced to call a general election within months in order to win a mandate for his plan."}

She is expected to unveil her plan on Thursday.\n\n\"You must know about the cost of living crisis in England, which is really quite bad at the moment,\" said Rebecca Macdougal, 55, who works in law enforcement, outside the Houses of Parliament.\n\n\"She's making promises for that, as she says she's going to deliver, deliver, deliver. But we will see in, hopefully, the next few weeks there'll be some announcements which will help the normal working person.\"\n\nTruss, 47, took office Tuesday afternoon at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, when Queen Elizabeth II formally asked her to form a new government in a carefully choreographed ceremony dictated by centuries of tradition. Johnson, who announced his intention to step down two months ago, formally resigned during his own audience with the queen a short time earlier.\n\nIt was the first time in the queen's 70-year reign that the handover of power took place at Balmoral, rather than Buckingham Palace in London. The ceremony was moved to Scotland to provide certainty about the schedule, because the 96-year-old queen has experienced problems getting around that have forced palace officials to make decisions about her travel on a day-to-day basis.\n\nTruss became prime minister a day after the ruling Conservative Party chose her as its leader in an election where the party's 172,000 dues-paying members were the only voters. As party leader, Truss automatically became prime minister without the need for a general election because the Conservatives still have a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nBut as a national leader selected by less than 0.5% of British adults, Truss is under pressure to show quick results.\n\nEd Davey, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, on Tuesday called for an early election in October \u2014 something that Truss and the Conservative Party are highly unlikely to do since the Tories are slumping in the polls.\n\n\"I've listened to Liz Truss during the Tory leadership (campaign) and I was looking for a plan to help people with their skyrocketing energy bills, with the NHS crisis and so on, and I heard no plan at all,\" he told the BBC. \"Given people are really worried, given people are losing sleep over their energy bills, businesses aren't investing because of the crisis, I think that's really wrong.\"\n\nJohnson took note of the strains facing Britain as he left the prime minister's official residence at No. 10 Downing Street for the last time, saying his policies had left the government with the economic strength to help people weather the energy crisis.\n\nAlways colorful, he thinly disguised his bitterness at being forced out.\n\n\"I am like one of those booster rockets that has fulfilled its function,\" Johnson said. \"I will now be gently re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down invisibly in some remote and obscure corner of the Pacific.''\n\nMany observers expect Johnson to attempt a political comeback, though he was cryptic about his plans. Instead, the man who studied classics at the University of Oxford backed Truss and compared himself to Cincinnatus, the Roman dictator who relinquished power and returned to his farm to live in peace.\n\n\"Like Cincinnatus, I am returning to my plow,\" he said.\n\nJohnson, 58, became prime minister three years ago after his predecessor, Theresa May, failed to deliver Britain's departure from the European Union. Johnson later won an 80-seat majority in Parliament with the promise to \"get Brexit done.\"\n\nBut he was forced out of office by a series of scandals that culminated in the resignation of dozens of Cabinet secretaries and lower-level officials in early July. That paved the way for Truss, a one-time accountant who was first elected to the House of Commons in 2010.\n\nMany people in Britain are still learning about their new leader.\n\nUnlike Johnson, who made himself a media celebrity long before he became prime minister, Truss rose quietly through the Conservative ranks before she was named foreign secretary, one of the top Cabinet posts, just a year ago.\n\nShe is expected to make her first speech as prime minister Tuesday afternoon outside No. 10 Downing Street.\n\nTruss is under pressure to spell out how she plans to help consumers pay household energy bills that are set to rise to an average of 3,500 pounds ($4,000) a year \u2014 triple the cost of a year ago \u2014 on Oct. 1 unless she intervenes.\n\nRising food and energy prices, driven by the invasion of Ukraine and the aftershocks of COVID-19 and Brexit, have propelled U.K. inflation above 10% for the first time in four decades. The Bank of England forecasts it will hit 13.3% in October, and that the U.K. will slip into a prolonged recession by the end of the year.\n\nTrain drivers, port staff, garbage collectors, postal workers and lawyers have all staged strikes to demand that pay increases keep pace with inflation, and millions more, from teachers to nurses, could walk out in the next few months.\n\nTruss, a low-tax, small-government conservative who admires Margaret Thatcher, says her priority is cutting taxes and slashing regulations to fuel economic growth. Critics say that will fuel further inflation while failing to address the cost-of-living crisis. The uncertainty has rattled money markets, driving the pound below $1.14 on Monday, its weakest since the 1980s.\n\nIn theory, Truss has time to make her mark: She doesn't have to call a national election until late 2024. But opinion polls already give the main opposition Labour Party a steady lead, and the worse the economy gets, the more pressure will grow.\n\nIn addition to Britain's domestic woes, Truss and her new Cabinet will also face multiple foreign policy crises, including the war in Ukraine and frosty post-Brexit relations with the EU.\n\nTruss, as foreign secretary, was a firm supporter of Ukraine's resistance to Russia. She has said her first phone call with a world leader will be to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nTruss has also pledged to increase U.K. defense spending to 3% of gross domestic product from just over 2% \u2014 another expensive promise.\n\nBut she's likely to have much cooler conversations with EU leaders, who were annoyed by her uncompromising stance as foreign secretary in talks over trade rules for Northern Ireland, an unresolved Brexit issue that has soured relations between London and Brussels. With the U.K. threatening to breach the legally binding divorce treaty, and the EU launching legal action in response, the dispute could escalate into a trade war.\n\n\"I think she's got a big, challenging job ahead of her,'' Robert Conway, 71, an electronics manufacturer, said in London. \"Hopefully she'll bring that, a new team, a new start, but it's going to be a challenging job.\""}

{"archive_url": "https://ssir.org/articles/entry/whats_next_curling_up_with_ereaders", "source_text": "Curling Up with E-Readers\n\nEfforts to improve global literacy typically focus on getting books into the hands of children. Could electronic reading devices leapfrog old-fashioned paper books and catalyze a new culture of reading in places like sub-Saharan Africa? That\u2019s the idea behind Worldreader.org, a start-up nonprofit with worldchanging aspirations.\n\nDispensing Kindles and other e-readers in the developing world may seem like a fancy solution to a low-tech problem. But Worldreader founder David Risher, a former Amazon executive, says the big goal is to drive down \u201cthe cost per book read to the absolute lowest it can be.\u201d Reading selections in many village schools are too limited and, he adds, often too Western to engage young readers. If donated books gather dust in the back of classrooms, they do little to engender a love of reading.\n\n\u201cLack of access to books has been solved by e-books,\u201d says Risher, noting that thousands of titles are available as digital books. \u201cBut there\u2019s no market-driven plan to get e-readers to the developing world.\u201d Worldreader, strong on corporate experience, intends to \u201cprime the market pump,\u201d he says, \u201cand put thousands of books into millions of kids\u2019 hands.\u201d\n\nThe infrastructure for supporting e-readers already exists in much of the developing world, thanks to a network for connecting and charging mobile phones in even the most remote regions. E-readers use the same network to download books. During Worldreader\u2019s trial in a village school in Ghana, students used an existing solar charging station to power up their Kindles, which were donated by Amazon. Their comfort with mobile phones and texting meant students had little trouble using e-reader features such as an online dictionary or text-to-speech capability. Because the devices include a built-in light source, students were able to introduce family members to a new activity: reading at home after dark.\n\nJonathan Wareham, professor and director of research at ESADE in Barcelona, Spain, has been studying Worldreader\u2019s early efforts. The low cost of distributing digital books offers great potential to improve literacy, he says, but the idea is not without challenges. Technical issues will be the easiest to solve, he predicts. \u201cGetting the supporting ecosystem around the device itself is where the work is.\u201d\n\nTo gain traction, Worldreader needs to create \u201ca system of content, distribution, pedagogy, administrative, cultural, and political support. These challenges are nothing less than massive,\u201d Wareham admits. \u201cYou go in expecting to address literacy, and you end up trying to rewrite cultural rules.\u201d\n\nTeachers may find e-readers easier to adopt than classroom computers because they don\u2019t call for a wholesale change of teaching methods. \u201cTeachers already know how to use books,\u201d Risher says. Compared with technology initiatives like One Laptop per Child, Worldreader \u201cis trying to solve a narrower problem,\u201d he adds.\n\nNor is Worldreader interested in pursuing a brick-and-mortar solution. Risher applauds global school-building initiatives like Room to Read, but says his organization is focusing on \u201cthe other side of the same coin. When people come together to learn, they still need access to books\u2014as many as possible.\u201d\n\nIdeally, those books will include culturally relevant titles by local authors. Worldreader is encouraging local publishers to digitize their book lists, which can then be sold online internationally. \u201cWe want to make sure they understand this is an economic opportunity for them,\u201d Risher says, emphasizing that digital book sales is not a business Worldreader wants to get into. \u201cWe want to be the catalyst to help make it happen.\u201d\n\nWorldreader\u2019s start-up costs have come largely from Risher and his co-founders, along with in-kind donations from Amazon and other businesses. Fundraising will be required to grow the lean organization, which currently operates from Seattle and Barcelona. There are plenty of unknowns, Risher admits. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the cost of e-readers in five years. We don\u2019t know the scale we will get to. We do know that Moore\u2019s Law is on our side. The cost continues going down.\u201d\n\nWorldreader expects to learn more from its next round of testing in Ghana. Will children read more if their reading choices are virtually unlimited? Will the novelty wear off once students get used to e-readers? From firsthand observation, Risher is encouraged. In a village in Ghana, he says, \u201cI\u2019d watch kids read one book, finish, then ask if they could download another. That\u2019s magical.\u201d\n\nSupport SSIR\u2019s coverage of cross-sector solutions to global challenges.\n\nHelp us further the reach of innovative ideas.
